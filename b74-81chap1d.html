<P><CENTER><B>The 1981 Edition</B></CENTER>

<P>The foreword to the 1968 edition stated that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Whereas the standards in this report are as final as they can be at the 
present time, the Department will revise them from time to time.  We recognize 
that, as with other published standards, to be effective and useful they must 
be revised and updated in light of both changes in practice and degree of 
success achieved in their application."</BLOCKQUOTE>  

<P>Sufficient changes in the field of water well construction and experience 
with applying the 1968 standards warrant revising them.  Foremost among the 
changes in construction practices are:

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>The development and use of plastic materials for casing in water wells.  
A subject only alluded to in the 1968 edition, the use of plastic well casing 
and screen has had phenomenal growth in the United States.  So much has the 
usage increased that a national materials standard has been developed and a 
manual of installation practices has just been published.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The use of the air rotary drilling method for constructing wells in the 
hard rock areas of the State.  Although this method of drilling was in use in 
1968, its use has mushroomed since then.  The equipment is very effective and 
very fast.  Coupled with the use of plastic well casing, the method has made 
the construction of a well several hundred feet deep in one day a common event 
in hard rock areas.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Rapid growth in the use of well screens in place of perforated casing in the 
intake sections of the wells.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Increased use of the reverse-circulation method of well drilling for large 
diameter deep wells in unconsolidated formations.  It too is an extremely fast method.</LI>
</OL>
















<P>Other factors include:

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>Population growth in the hilly and mountainous rural areas of California, 
which has resulted in a heavy demand for individual and community water supplies in those areas.
</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The 1976-77 drought, the most severe in a half-century, which caused a heavy 
demand for new wells, replacement wells, and well deepenings.  It also produced an 
increased awareness of the significance of the State's groundwater resources.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The increasing cost of energy for pumping.  In terms of well construction 
and operation, this has meant greater interest in the design of efficient 
wells and in well maintenance (previously, a much neglected activity).</LI>
</OL>

<P>These as well as other considerations led to the decision to revise the 1968 
edition.

<P>This edition is composed of this chapter, Chapter II, "Standards", and five 
appendixes.

<P>While there have been a number of modifications and additions to them, the 23 
sections of Chapter II, "Standards", are as listed in the 1968 edition.  All 
references to existing laws, standards, and publications have been updated 
and, where appropriate, additional explanation is provided.  Every effort has 
been made to clarify wording to ensure its understanding.  A number of 
figures illustrating the standards have been included.

<P>Many technical terms concerning groundwater and water well construction are 
frequently misunderstood or misinterpreted.  The term "seal" or "sealing", 
for example, has several meanings in the jargon of the well driller, 
geologist, and engineer, depending on what part of the well installation is 
under discussion.  In this report, we have tried to ensure that the technical 
terms used are understandable.

<P>A list of definitions appears in <a href="b74-81appendixa.html">Appendix A</a>.
 Certain definitions are made a part of the standards and are presented in Chapter II.
 <a href="b74-81appendixb.html">Appendix B</a>,
 <a href="b74-81appendixc.html">Appendix C</a>, and
 <a href="b74-81appendixd.html">Appendix D</a>
 describe sealing methods, disinfection, and water quality sampling respectively.

<P>Numerous publications relating to the construction of water wells and to the 
development, use, and protection of groundwaters have been reviewed in 
preparation of this report.  Included is a considerable body of literature on 
well construction that has been written since 1968.  They are listed in 
<a href="b74-81appendixe.html">Appendix E</a> in alphabetical order by author.
