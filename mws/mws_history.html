<P><CENTER><B>History of Monitoring Wells</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Monitoring wells were first used mainly for water level measurement.  These 
wells were often referred to as piezometers in reference to the "piezometric 
surface" of groundwater.  In recent years, the term "piezometric surface" is 
often replaced by "potentiometric surface."  However, the term "piezometer" 
is still sometimes used for monitoring wells installed only for water level 
measurement.</P>

<P>Many water level monitoring wells constructed in the past were relatively 
large in diameter in comparison to today's monitoring wells.  Wells up to 10-
inches in diameter were often constructed to accommodate various means of 
water level measurement, including floats for mechanically-operated, 
continuous water level recorders.  Many inactive water wells that could 
accommodate mechanical water level recording equipment were used as 
monitoring wells.</P>

<P>Modern electronic water level measuring and recording devices now allow for 
small-diameter water-level monitoring wells.  Some continuous water-level 
measurement devices can be used in wells less than 2-inches in inside 
diameter.</P>

<P>The use of monitoring wells for groundwater sampling for chemical analysis 
has increased significantly in the past two decades.  The following factors 
have all served to increase the frequency and scope of groundwater quality 
investigations and the number of monitoring wells constructed:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Advances in analytical and environmental chemistry;</LI>

<LI>Increased knowledge of the adverse effects of chemicals on humans;</LI>

<LI>Public awareness of groundwater pollution;</LI>

<LI>The advent of federal groundwater quality protection legislation in the 
1970s, and,</LI>

<LI>Statutes relating to groundwater enacted by the California Legislature.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Since the 1970s an entire industry has developed around groundwater quality 
monitoring and monitoring well construction.  Numerous private firms are 
involved in providing technical services for the design and implementation of 
groundwater quality investigations.  Many firm are involved in the 
manufacture, distribution, and marketing of materials and equipment used in 
constructing and operating monitoring wells.</P>

<P>Most monitoring wells constructed today are used to assess:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The nature and distribution of pollutants and contaminants in groundwater;</LI>

<LI>The nature and distribution of naturally occurring chemical constituents;</LI>

<LI>Subsurface hydrologic conditions; and,</LI>

<LI>Hydraulic properties of strata as they relate to pollutant and contaminant 
movement.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Some monitoring wells are designed to be multipurpose.  Monitoring wells can 
sometimes be used as "extraction" or "injection" wells for mitigation of 
pollution or contamination.</P>

<P>Although a significant number of monitoring wells constructed today are for 
detection and assessment of groundwater quality impairment, many monitoring 
wells are constructed for evaluating groundwater supply conditions by 
allowing groundwater level measurement and/or aquifer testing.  Still others 
are constructed for observing water levels associated with excavations and 
irrigated agriculture.</P>

<P>During 1989, approximately 20 percent of all well drilling in California was 
for monitoring wells, based on well driller's reports received by the 
Department of Water Resources.  Monitoring wells have been constructed in 
nearly all California counties.  The largest concentrations of water quality 
monitoring wells occur in metropolitan areas of the State.  Large numbers of 
monitoring wells are installed for detection and assessment of leaks from 
underground storage tanks.</P>
