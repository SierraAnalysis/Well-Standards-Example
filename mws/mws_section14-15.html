<P><B>Section 14.  Rehabilitation and Repair of Monitoring Wells.</B></P>

<P>For the purpose of these standards, "well rehabilitation" includes the 
treatment of a well to recover loss in yield caused by intrusion or clogging 
of the screen, filter pack, and/or water-bearing strata adjoining the well.  
Well rehabilitation methods that may, in certain cases, be acceptable for 
monitoring wells include mechanical surging, backwashing or surging by 
alternately starting or stopping a pump, surging with air, water jetting, 
sonic cleaning, chemical treatment, or combinations of these.</P>  

<P>Rehabilitation methods shall be performed with care to prevent damage to the 
well and any barriers that serve to restrict the movement of poor-quality 
water, pollutants, or contaminants.  Chemicals used for rehabilitation shall 
be completely removed from the well, filter pack, and water-bearing strata 
accessed by the well immediately after rehabilitation operations are 
completed.  Chemicals, water, and other waste shall be disposed of in 
accordance with applicable federal, State, and local requirements.  The 
enforcing agency should be contacted regarding the proper disposal of waste 
from rehabilitation operations.</P>

<P>Rehabilitation methods should be compatible with the use of the monitoring 
well.  Special care should be given to the selection of rehabilitation 
methods for water-quality monitoring wells.</P>

<P>Materials used for repairing well casing shall meet the requirements of 
<a href="mws_section12.html">Section 12 of these standards</a>.</P>

<P id=15><B>Section 15.  Temporary Cover.</B></P>

<P>The well or borehole opening and any associated excavations shall be covered 
at the surface to ensure public safety and to prevent the entry of foreign 
material, water, contaminants, and pollutants whenever work is interrupted by 
such events as overnight shutdown, poor weather, and required waiting periods 
to allow setting of sealing materials and the performance of tests.  The 
cover shall be held in place or weighted down in such a manner that it cannot 
be removed except by equipment or tools.</P>
