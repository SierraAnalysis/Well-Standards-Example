<P><B>Section 13.  Well Development.</B></P>

<P>Monitoring well development, redevelopment, and reconditioning shall be 
performed with care so as to prevent damage to the well and any strata 
surrounding the well that serve to restrict the movement of poor-quality 
water, pollutants, and contaminants.  Developments, redevelopment, and 
reconditioning operations shall be performed with special care where a well 
has been constructed in an area of known or suspected pollution or 
contamination.  Such special care is necessary to prevent the spread of 
pollutants and contaminants in the environment and to protect public health 
and safety.</P>   

<P>Water, sediment and other waste removed from a monitoring well for 
"development" operations shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable 
federal, State, and local requirements.  The enforcing agency should be 
contacted concerning the proper disposal of waste from development 
operations.</P>

<P>Appropriate methods of well development vary with the type and use of 
monitoring a well.  Development methods that may be acceptable under certain 
circumstances include:</P>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Mechanical Surging.</I>  Plungers, bailers, surge blocks, and other surging 
devices shall incorporate safety valves or vents to prevent excessive 
pressure differentials that could damage casing or screen.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Overpumping and Pump Surging.</I>  Overpumping and surging may not be 
suitable for development of wells producing large amounts of sediment because 
of the potential for clogging or jamming of pumps.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Air Development.</I>  Some air development methods are not acceptable for 
monitoring wells to be used for sensitive water-quality determinations.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Water Jetting.</I>  Water used in jetting operations shall be free of 
pollutants and contaminants.  Water-jetting methods are not always acceptable 
for monitoring wells used for sensitive water-quality determinations.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Chemical Development.</I>  Extreme care shall be exercised in the use of 
chemicals for monitoring well development.  It is often unacceptable to use 
chemicals for developing monitoring wells to be used for water-quality 
determinations.  Chemicals introduced for development shall be completely 
removed from the well, filter pack, and water-bearing strata accessed by the 
well immediately after development operations are completed.

<P>The various methods described above are sometimes used in combination.</P>
