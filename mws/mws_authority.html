<P><CENTER><B>Authority and Responsibilities of Other Agencies</B></CENTER></P>

<P>As discussed above, Congress enacted major legislation dealing with 
groundwater quality protection during the 1970s.  Regulatory programs 
initiated by federal legislation, such as the Resources Conservation and 
Recovery Act (RCRA) and its amendments, are administered by the <a href="http://www.epa.gov" target="_blank">U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency</a>.  Some administration and enforcement 
activities related to federal legislation have been delegated to California 
State agencies.</P>

<P>The California Legislature enacted legislation expanding efforts for 
groundwater quality protection in California beyond federal requirements.  
The Legislature assigned several State agencies various responsibilities for 
investigation, mitigation, and control of groundwater pollution and 
contamination.</P>

<P>The lead enforcement agency for most groundwater quality protection issues in 
California is the <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov" target="_blank">State Water Resources Control Board</a> (State Board) and the 
nine <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/regions.html" target="_blank">California Regional Quality Control Boards</a> (Regional Boards).  The State 
Board oversees the activities of the nine Regional Boards.</P>

<P>The <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Health Services</a> or, 
under some circumstances, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov" target="_blank">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, 
is the lead enforcement agency for groundwater quality issues related to hazardous wastes.</P>

<P><I>The EPA, the Department of Health Services, and the State Board have adopted 
regulations or standards establishing monitoring requirements for "waste 
facilities".  These regulations or standards include requirements for design 
and performance of monitoring wells that are often more stringent than 
standards in this bulletin.</I></P>

<P>Other State government organizations concerned or directly involved with 
groundwater quality assessment or protection in California include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Department of Conservation, <a href="http://www.consrv.ca.gov/dog/index.htm" target="_blank">Division of Oil and Gas</a>,</LI>

<LI><a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Food and Agriculture</a>,</LI>

<LI><a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov" target="_blank">Integrated Waste Management Board</a>, and,</LI>

<LI>Department of Water Resources.</LI>
</UL>

California cities, counties, and local water agencies are also involved with 
groundwater quality assessment and protection.

<P>The <a href="http://www.consrv.ca.gov/dog/index.htm" target="_blank">Division of Oil and Gas</a> has authority and responsibility for geothermal 
wells and other special wells constructed in the State's Geothermal Resources 
Areas (pursuant to Chapter 4, Division 3, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=prc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Public Resources Code</a>).  
Shallow wells drilled for geothermal observation are subject to regulations 
and standards established by DOG.</P>

<P>After July 17, 1991, the <a href="http://www.calepa.ca.gov" target="_blank">California Environmental Protection Agency</a> will 
oversee the activities of the <a href="http://www.swrcb.ca.gov" target="_blank">State Water Resources Control Board</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov" target="_blank">Integrated Waste Management Board</a>. 
Some of the environmental protection activities of the <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Health Services</a> 
and the <a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Food 
and Agriculture</a> will also come under the California Environmental Protection 
Agency.</P>
