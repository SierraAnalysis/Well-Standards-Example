<P>Groundwater monitoring wells are principally used for observing groundwater 
levels and flow conditions, obtaining samples for determining groundwater 
quality, and for evaluating hydraulic properties of water-bearing strata.  
Monitoring wells are sometimes referred to as "observation wells."</P>

<P>The quality of water intercepted by a monitoring well can range from drinking 
water to highly polluted water.  In contrast, production or "water wells" are 
usually designed to obtain water from productive zones containing good-
quality water.</P>

<P>The screen or perforated section of a monitoring well usually extends only a 
short length to obtain water from, or to monitor conditions within, an 
individual water-bearing unit or zone.  Water wells are often designed to 
obtain water from multiple water-bearing strata.  Although there are usually 
differences between the design and function of monitoring wells and the water 
wells, water wells sometimes are used as monitoring wells, and vice versa.</P>

<P>Monitoring wells, along with other types of wells, can provide a pathway for 
the movement of poor-quality water, pollutants, and contaminants.  Because 
monitoring wells are often purposely located in areas affected by pollutants 
and contaminants, they pose an especially significant threat to groundwater 
quality if they are not properly constructed, altered, maintained, and 
destroyed.</P>

<P>The California Legislature amended the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water Code</a> in 1986 
specifically to include requirements for monitoring well standards.  
Monitoring wells were previously assumed by the Department to be covered by 
the collective term "well" in the law.</P>
