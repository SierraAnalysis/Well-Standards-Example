<P><FONT size=-1>One other report, Bulletin 74-1, "Cathodic Protection Well Standards: 
State of California", March 1973 deals with another kind of well. 
Cathodic protection wells house devices used to alleviate electrolytic corrosion of 
pipelines, tanks, and similar installations. Such wells may also function as 
instruments for the deterioration of groundwater quality. For that reason, standards 
for their construction and destruction have also been issued.</FONT>
