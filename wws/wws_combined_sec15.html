CHAPTER II.  STANDARDS

<P id="sec15"><B>Section 15.  Water Quality Sampling.</B><A HREF="javascript:newWindow18()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 18</SUP></FONT></A></P>

<P>The requirements to be followed with respect to water quality sampling are:</P>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Community Water Supply Wells and Certain Industrial Wells.</I>  The water from 
all community water supply wells and industrial wells which provide water for 
use in food processing shall be sampled immediately following development and 
disinfection, and appropriate analysis made.
Rules and regulations governing the constituents to be tested, type of 
testing, etc, for community water supply systems are contained in Chapter 15, 
"Domestic Water Quality and Monitoring", of Title 22, California 
Administrative Code.  Water analysis shall be performed by a laboratory 
certified by the California <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Health Services</a>. 
A copy of the laboratory analysis shall be forwarded to the California Department of Health 
Services or to the local health department.  Approval of the enforcing agency 
must be obtained before the well is put into use. 

<P>Except where there is free discharge from the pump (that is, there is no 
direct connection to the water delivery system such as to a sump), a sample 
tap (see <A HREF="javascript:newWindowf7()">Figure 7</A>) shall be provided on the discharge line so that water 
representative of the water in the well may be drawn for laboratory analysis.  
The tap shall be located so as to prevent back siphonage to the pump 
discharge when the pump is shut off (e.g., on the system side of the check 
valve).</P>
</LI>

<LI><I>Other Types of Wells.</I>  To determine the quality of water produced by a new 
well it should be sampled immediately following construction and development.  
Appropriate analyses shall be made based upon the intended uses of the water.</LI>
