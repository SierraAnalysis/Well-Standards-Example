<P><FONT size=-1>Included are wells used for the injection of reclaimed waste water.
 Injection wells are also used to dispose of unusable waste water into formations containing water of unusable quality (such as highly mineralized waters) or dry, nonproductive formations.
 These latter wells can penetrate usable groundwater zones but are not permitted to open into usable water (Chapeter 7, Division 7, California Water Code; Section 4458, California Health and Safety Code; and Chapter 1, Division 3, California Public Resources Code).
 "Dry" wells, "drainage" wells, and sewer wells also fall into this category.
 Their existance and operation is also subject to the aforementioned provisions of the State law.</FONT><BR>
