CHAPTER II.  STANDARDS

<P>Part III.  Destruction of Wells</P>

<P><B>Section 20.  Purpose of Destruction.</B></P>

A well that is no longer useful<A HREF="javascript:newWindow21()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 21</SUP></FONT></A> (including exploration and test holes) must 
be destroyed in order to:

1. Assure that the groundwater supply is protected and preserved for further 
use.

2.  Eliminate the potential physical hazard.




<P id=21><B>Section 21. Definition of "Abandoned" Well.</B></P>

<P>A well is considered 'abandoned' or permanently inactive if it has not been 
used for one year, unless the owner demonstrates intention to use the well 
again.  In accordance with Section 115700 of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=hsc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Health and safety 
Code</a>, the well owner shall properly maintain an inactive well as evidence of 
intention for future use in such a way that the following requirements are 
met:</P>

<P>(1)  The well shall not allow impairment of the quality of water within the 
well and groundwater encountered by the well.</P>

<P>(2)  The top of the well or well casing shall be provided with a cover, that 
is secured by a lock or by other means to prevent its removal without the use 
of equipment or tools, to prevent unauthorized access, to prevent a safety 
hazard to humans and animals, and to prevent illegal disposal of wastes in 
the well.  The cover shall be watertight where the top of the well casing or 
other surface openings to the well are below ground level, such as in a vault 
or below known levels of flooding.  The cover shall be watertight if the well 
is inactive for more than five consecutive years.  A pump or motor, angle 
drive, or other surface feature of a well, when in compliance with the above 
provisions, shall suffice as a cover.</P>

<P>(3)  The well shall be marked so as to be easily visible and located, and 
labeled so as to be easily identified as a well.</P>

<P>(4)  The area surrounding the well shall be kept clear of brush, debris, and 
waste materials.</P>

<P>If a pump has been temporarily removed for repair or replacement, the well 
shall not be considered 'abandoned' if the above conditions are met.  The 
well shall be adequately covered to prevent injury to people and animals and 
to prevent the entrance of foreign material, surface water, pollutants, or 
contaminants into the well during the pump repair period.</P>




<P id=22><B>Section 22.  General Requirement.</B></P>

<P>All "abandoned" wells and exploration or test holes shall be destroyed.  The 
objective of destruction is to restore as nearly as possible those subsurface 
conditions which existed before the well was constructed taking into account 
also changes, if any, which have occurred since the time of construction.  
(For example, an aquifer which may have produced good quality water at one 
time but which now produces water of inferior quality, such as a coastal 
aquifer that has been invaded by seawater.)</P>

<P>Destruction of a well shall consist of the complete filling of the well in 
accordance with the procedures described in <a href="wws_combined_sec23.html#sec23">Section 23</a> (following).</P>
