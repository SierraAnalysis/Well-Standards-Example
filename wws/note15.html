<P><FONT size=-1>Selection of casing depends on its ability to resist external forces as well as factors affecting the casing serviceability.
 The maximum theoretical external pressure under which a particular well casing of a specific diameter and thickness will collapse can be calculated.
 However, other considerations such as the effect of driving the casing into place or other impact forces which may have an effect on the ability of a particular casing to resist external pressures, cannot be calculated  with accuracy.
 Good design practices preclude the selection of a casing of a particular thickness for use where it will experience external pressures approaching the maximum or where unknown forces might magnify the effect of the external forces.
 Instead it is customary for designers to introduce factors of safety which tend to ensure that the casing selected will resist all probable forces imposed upon it.
 Consequently, experience and sound judgement, coupled with these factors or safety, have so far proved to be the best guide in selecting the proper casing.
 Suggested thicknesses for steel casing for various depths and diameters are to be found in material published by the various steel manufactures and fabricators and in publications on the design of water wells.
 The suggested thickness contained in such publications are not to be considered a part of these standards.</FONT><BR>
