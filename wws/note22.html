<P><FONT size=-1>Determining the significance of interchange of waters whose qualities vary and of the loss of artesian pressures, requires extensive knowledge of the groundwater basin in question.
 The Department of Water Resources has over the years, and frequently in cooperation with agencies such as the U. S. Geological Survey, undertaken a number of groundwater studies and amassed considerable information and data about the subject.
 Although much is known about the State's groundwater supplies, detailed studies sufficiently accurate to define interchange problems have been made only in certain areas.
 In still other areas, there is only partial definition of the problem.
 Examples of areas where definition has been made are the coastal plain of Los Angeles County and the eastern part of the Santa Clara Valley in Alameda County.
 An excellent example of a "bottom" water is the saline connate water underlying the Central Valley at varying depths.</FONT><BR>
