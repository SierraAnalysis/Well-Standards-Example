<P><CENTER><B>INTRODUCTION</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Most wells in California are constructed to extract groundwater, inject 
water, or monitor groundwater conditions.  Other, less common types of wells 
include cathodic protection wells.  Cathodic protection wells, sometimes 
called 'deep groundbeds,' house devices to minimize electrolytic corrosion of 
metallic pipelines, tanks, and other facilities in contact with the ground.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>Electrolytic Corrosion</B></CENTER></P>

<P><IMG SRC="../figures/74-90fig4.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=255 ALT="Figure 4">
For the purpose of these standards, electrolytic corrosion is defined as the 
deterioration of metallic objects by electrochemical reaction with the 
environment.  The electrolytic corrosion process is illustrated in Figure 4 
for a metallic pipeline in a soil-water environment.  This process gradually 
weakens the pipeline and can cause its failure.</P>
  
<P>In Figure 4, an electric potential is induced on the surface of the pipeline 
as a result of variations in the concentrations of salts in the soil and 
water surrounding the pipeline.  This potential results in an electric 
current in the soil-water electrolyte.  Current flows from an "anode area" on 
the pipeline to a "cathode area" on the pipeline.  Metal is removed from the 
anode area by the current.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>Cathodic Protection</B></CENTER></P>

<P><IMG SRC="../figures/74-90fig5.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=255 ALT="Figure 5">
"Cathodic protection" is a term used for certain measures taken to prevent or 
minimize electrolytic corrosion of metallic equipment and structures.  
Cathodic protection devices redirect current to flow from a "sacrificial" 
anode to the soils-water electrolyte, instead of from an anode area on a 
pipeline or other metallic structure to be protected.  The protective anode's 
role is to corrode in place of the metallic object it is designed to protect, 
as shown in Figure 5.  The protected facility is made to be a permanent 
cathode by use of cathodic protection devices.  Thus, the facility is said to 
be "cathodically protected."</P>

<P>Protective or sacrificial anodes can be placed close to ground surface or at 
significant depth.  Anodes have been placed at shallow depths in horizontal 
and vertical arrays for many years.  Shallow arrays are often not well suited 
for metropolitan areas because of land requirements, or suited for areas 
where electrical interference may be high.</P>

<P>Deep vertical anode installations, usually referred to as "cathodic 
protection wells," were first developed and used during the 1940s.  They were 
developed in response to the constraints of shallow anode arrays.</P>


<P><CENTER><B>Cathodic Protection Wells</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Cathodic protection wells are widely installed to protect metallic objects in 
contact with the ground from electrolytic corrosion.  Such objects include 
petroleum, natural gas, and water pipelines, and related storage facilities; 
power lines; telephone cables; and switchyards.  Cathodic protection wells 
are sometimes used to control electrolytic corrosion in large water wells.</P>

<P>Many cathodic protection wells have been constructed to protect pipelines 
that transport natural gas or other "hazardous" materials.  The Natural Gas 
Pipeline Safety Act, Public Law 90-481 adopted by Congress in August 1968, 
provides requirements for cathodic protection of certain pipelines.</P>

<P>Most cathodic protection wells in California are located in areas where 
underground pipelines or "conveyance" systems are numerous and must be 
protected.  These areas include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>South coastal region from San Diego to Santa Barbara,</LI>
<LI>Oil-producing areas of the southern San Joaquin Valley and the Central Coast, 
and</LI>
<LI>San Francisco Bay Area.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Few cathodic protection wells exist in California north of Sacramento.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../figures/74-90fig6.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=444 ALT="Figure 6">
Many cathodic protection wells, as llustrated in Figure 6, have been 
constructed by:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Drilling a 6- to 12-inch diameter borehole to a desired depth.  Cathodic 
protection wells normally range from 100 to 500 feet in total depth.  A few 
wells have been constructed to depths of 800 feet.

<P><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water Code</a> Section 13711 defines a "cathodic protection well" as 
an anode installation exceeding 50 feet in depth.  Installations less than 50 
feet deep are "legally" considered "shallow anodes," not cathodic protection 
wells.  Shallow anode installations are not specifically covered by these 
standards.</P></LI>

<LI>Placing a string of anodes in the borehole within a designated interval, 
usually referred to as the "anode interval."</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Backfilling the anode interval around the anodes with an electrically 
conductive material, such as granular coke.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Installing a small-diameter vent pipe that extends from the top of the 
anode interval to land surface, or above.  The purpose of the vent pipe is to 
release generated gases.  Medium to large-diameter pipe or casing used in 
water wells to maintain the well bore and house pumping equipment is not 
normally used for cathodic protection wells.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Backfilling the annulus between the vent pipe and borehole wall with an 
electrically non-conductive fill material to a specific height above the 
anode interval.  Such fill material usually consists of uniform, small-
diameter gravel.  Its purpose is to provide a permeable medium for migration 
of gases and to stabilize the walls of the borehole.

<P>In the past this material was sometimes used to fill the annulus between the 
vent pipe and the borehole wall from the top of the anode interval to land 
surface.  These standards require specific interval(s) of the upper annular 
space of a cathodic protection well be filled with sealing materials instead 
of gravel, to protect groundwater quality.</P></LI>

<LI>Sealing the annulus between the vent pipe and the borehole wall, from 
the top of the non-conductive annular fill to land surface, with sealing 
material.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Installing a permanent cover over the well at ground surface.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Connecting the anode leads to the facility to be protected, possible 
through an electrical current source.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Individual designs of cathodic protection wells vary.</P>

<P>The protective anodes of a cathodic protection well usually corrode away with 
time.  Thus a cathodic protection well's anodes determine the well's useful 
life.  Anodes are usually designed to last 15 to 20 years.</P>

<P>There has been an increasing tendency to construct cathodic protection wells 
with large diameter vent pipe or casing so that anodes can be replaced 
through the casing.  Anode replacement through casing eliminates the need to 
drill replacement wells when anodes have been expended.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>Corrosion Coordinating Committees</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Serious electrical interference problems can occur where cathodic protection 
networks criss-cross one another or are too close to one another.  Also, 
stray currents produced from electrical transmission lines and other 
equipment can sometimes interfere with the operation of cathodic protection 
systems.  Interference problems are usually most pronounced in urban areas.</P>

<P>Corrosion control coordinating organizations have been formed in areas of 
California to overcome system interferences and other problems.  Most 
organizations are affiliated with or are chapters of the <a href="http://nace.org/nace/index.asp" target="_blank">National Association 
of Corrosion Engineers</a>.</P>

<P>Corrosion control organizations represent the majority of utilities and other 
groups that install cathodic protection devices, including cathodic 
protection wells.  Organization members coordinate the installation and 
operation of cathodic protection facilities with the goal of minimizing 
problems of electrical interference.</P>

<P>Four organizations that deal with Central and Southern California are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Southern California

<P>The Southern California Cathodic Protection Committee is a formal committee 
covering all of Southern California south of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and Inyo 
counties, except San Diego County.</P></LI>

<LI>San Diego County

<P>The San Diego County Underground Corrosion Control Committee is an informal 
organization that deals with the San Diego area.</P></LI>

<LI>Central California

<P>The Central California Cathodic Protection Committee is a formal committee 
covering all of Central California plus Sacramento Valley counties, and 
western Sierra Nevada mountain counties south of Plumas County.</P></LI>

<LI>San Francisco Bay Area

<P>The activities of the two committees that formerly covered the San Francisco 
Bay Area have been assumed by the San Francisco Section of the National 
Association of Corrosion Engineers.  The committees were disbanded in 1985.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P>No coordinating organizations function in coastal counties north of San 
Francisco or in the northeastern part of the State.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, not all who install and operate cathodic protection facilities 
work with a corrosion coordinating organization.  Those not associated with 
an organization are usually individuals or local agencies that are sometimes 
unaware of the existence of other installations.  Non-coordinated facilities 
can seriously interfere with one another electrically.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>Need for Cathodic Protection Well Standards</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Cathodic protection wells, along with other types of wells, can allow 
groundwater quality degradation to occur.  Improperly constructed or 
destroyed cathodic protection wells can constitute a preferential pathway for 
the movement of poor-quality water, pollutants, and contaminants.  Cathodic 
protection wells constructed with gravel backfill to land surface are 
particularly conducive to the movement of poor-quality water, pollutants, or 
contaminants.</P>

<P>Water and electrolytes are sometimes introduced into cathodic protection 
wells through vent pipes, or gravel fill in the annulus, to keep wells 
functional where natural electrolytes are lacking.  Such a practice could be 
considered "waste disposal" and may be illegal if poor-quality water is used.</P>

<P>Permanently inactive cathodic protection wells pose a threat for the movement 
of poor-quality water, pollutants, and contaminants, and should be properly 
destroyed.  Permanently inactive cathodic protection wells are a threat to 
groundwater quality because they become dilapidated with time, are sometimes 
forgotten, and are sometimes used for waste disposal.</P>

<P>Many cathodic protection wells have small diameter vent pipes that prevent 
entry by persons and most animals.  However, large vent pipe sizes can pose a 
serious safety threat if left open at land surface.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>History of Cathodic Protection Well Standards</B></CENTER></P>

<P>The California Legislature enacted legislation in 1949 directing the 
California Department of Water Resources to develop recommended water-quality 
protection standards for the construction and destruction of wells.  The 
Legislature amended the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">Water Code</a> in 1968 to require standards for cathodic 
protection wells.</P>

<P>Cathodic protection well standards for California were first published in 
1973 as DWR Bulletin 74-1, Cathodic Protection Well Standards:  State of 
California.  Standards presented here replace those contained in Bulletin 74-1. 
Additional discussion on the history of well standards is contained in 
the "introduction" section of this supplement (Bulletin 74-90) and Bulletin 
74-81, Water Well Standards:  State of California.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>Scope of Standards</B></CENTER></P>

<P>The following are recommended minimum standards for construction, alteration, 
maintenance, and destruction of cathodic protection wells in California.  
They only serve as minimum guidelines toward ensuring cathodic protection 
wells do not constitute a significant pathway for movement of poor-quality 
water, pollutants, and contaminants.  These standards do not ensure a 
cathodic protection well will perform its corrosion protection function 
adequately.</P>

<P>The functional requirements for cathodic protection wells may conflict with 
the application of certain standards for the protection of water quality.  
Consequently, some compromise has been made between well function and 
resource protection in the development of these standards.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>Organization of Standards</B></CENTER></P>

<P>These standards are arranged in a format similar to the <a href="../wws/wws_combined.html">Water Well Standards</a>.  
Since many of the standards that apply to water wells also apply to cathodic 
protection wells, many references are made in these standards to the Water 
Well Standards.  Standards that apply only to cathodic protection wells or 
that require emphasis for cathodic protection wells, are discussed in detail 
in these standards.</P>
