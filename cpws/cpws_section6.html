Structures.</B></P>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Separation.</I>  Cathodic protection wells shall be located an adequate 
distance from known or potential sources of pollution or contamination, where 
site constraints and corrosion control considerations allow.  Potential 
sources of pollution and contamination include those listed in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec8.html">Section 8 of 
the Water Well Standards</a>.

<P>As specified in <a href="cpws_section7.html#sec7">Section 7</a> below, the length of the annular seal for a 
cathodic protection well shall be increased if the well is located in a 
congested urban area, or is located within 100 feet of any potential source 
of pollution or contamination.</P></LI>

<LI><I>Flooding and Drainage.</I>  Cathodic protection wells should be located in 
areas protected from flooding, if possible.  Wells located in areas of 
flooding shall be protected from flood waters and drainage, including 
protective measures outlined in <a href="cpws_section8.html#sec8">Section 8</a>, below.

<P>Ground surface surrounding a cathodic protection well shall slope away from 
the well.  Drainage from areas surrounding a cathodic protection well shall 
be directed away from the well.</P></LI>

<LI><I>Accessibility.</I>  All cathodic protection wells shall be located an 
adequate distance from buildings and other structures to allow access for 
well maintenance, modification, repair, and destruction, unless otherwise 
approved by the enforcing agency.</LI>
