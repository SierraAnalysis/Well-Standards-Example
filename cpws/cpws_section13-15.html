<P><B>Section 13.  Purpose of Destruction.</B></P>

<P>A cathodic protection well that is no longer useful, permanently inactive or 
"abandoned" must be properly destroyed to:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1)  Ensure the quality of groundwater is protected, and,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(2)  Eliminate a possible physical hazard to humans and animals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P id=14><B>Section 14.  Definition of "Abandoned" Cathodic Protection Well.</B></P>

<P>A cathodic protection well is considered "abandoned" or permanently inactive 
when its anodes are exhausted and cannot, or will not, be replaced.  A 
cathodic protection well is also considered "abandoned" or permanently 
inactive if it has not been used for one year, unless the owner demonstrates 
intention to use it again.  To provide evidence of intention for future use 
of a well, the well owner, in accordance with Section 24400 of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=hsc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">Health and 
Safety Code</a>, shall maintain the well in such a way that the following 
requirements are met:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"(1)  The well shall not allow impairment of the quality of water within the 
well and groundwater encountered by the well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(2)  The top of the well casing shall be provided with a cover, that is 
secured by a lock or by other means to prevent its removal without the use of 
equipment or tools to prevent unauthorized access, to prevent a safety hazard 
to humans and animal, and to prevent illegal disposal of wastes in the well.  
The cover shall be watertight where the top of the well casing or other 
surface openings to the well are below ground level, such as in a vault or 
below known levels of flooding.  The cover shall be watertight if the well is 
inactive for more than five consecutive years.  A pump motor, angle drive, or 
other surface feature of a well, when in compliance with the above 
provisions, shall suffice as a cover.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(3)  The well shall be marked so as to be easily visible and located, and 
labeled so as to be easily identified as a well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(4)  The area surrounding the well shall be kept clear of brush, debris, and 
waste materials."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P id=15><B>Section 15.  General Requirements.</B></P>

<P>All permanently inactive or "abandoned" cathodic protection wells shall be 
properly destroyed.  The purpose of destruction is to prevent a possible 
safety hazard to humans and animals and to eliminate the well structure as a 
possible means for the preferential migration of poor-quality water, 
pollutants, and contaminants.</P>
