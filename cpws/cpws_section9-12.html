<P><CENTER><B>Part II.  Cathodic Protection Well Construction</B></CENTER></P>

<P id="sec9"><B>Section 9.  Casing.</B></P>

<P>Vent pipe, anode access tubing, and any other tubular materials that pass 
through the interval to be filled and sealed are all considered casing for 
the purpose of these standards.  Materials used for cathodic protection well 
casing generally shall meet the requirements for casing materials and their 
installation in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec12.html">Section 12 of the Water Well Standards</a>. 
Variance from the standards shall be at the approval of the enforcing agency. 
It is recommended that practices prescribed by the <a href="http://nace.org/nace/index.asp" target="_blank">National Association 
of Corrosion Engineers</a> also be followed in the design and installation of gas 
vents and electrical conduit.</P>

<P>Cathodic protection well casing should be at least 2 inches in internal 
diameter to facilitate eventual well destruction.</P>

<P id="sec10"><B>Section 10.  Sealing-Off Strata.</B></P>

<P>If a cathodic protection well penetrates a stratum or strata below the 
minimum required annular surface seal depth specified in <a href="cpws_section7.html#sec7">Section 7</a>, above and 
the stratum contains poor-quality water, pollutants, or contaminants that 
could mix with and degrade water contained in other strata penetrated by the 
well, additional annular sealing material shall be placed below the minimum 
required annular surface seal to prevent mixing and water-quality 
degradation.</P>

<P>The following minimum requirements shall be observed for isolating zones 
containing poor-quality water, pollutants, or contaminants for various cases:</P>

<P><I>Case 1.  Upper Stratum.</I>  If a stratum containing poor-quality water, 
pollutants, or contaminants lies above a stratum to be protected, annular 
seal material shall extend from the top of the stratum containing the poor-quality 
water, pollutants, or contaminants down at least 10 feet into the 
confining layer separating the two strata, or through the entire thickness of 
the confining layer, whichever is least.</P>

<P><I>Case 2.  Lower Stratum.</I>  If a stratum containing poor-quality water, 
pollutants, or contaminants lies below a stratum to be protected, the annular 
space opposite the stratum to be protected shall be sealed along its full 
length.  The seal shall extend at least 10 feet into the confining layer 
separating the two strata, or through the entire thickness of the confining 
layer, whichever is least.</P>

<P><I>Case 3.  Multiple Strata.</I></P>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Where two or more strata containing poor-quality water, pollutants, or 
contaminants are adjacent to one another and overlie a stratum to be 
protected, the annular space opposite the strata containing poor-quality 
water, pollutants, or contaminants and opposite all interbedded confining 
layers shall be sealed.  The annular seal shall extend at least 10 feet down 
into, or completely through, whichever is least, the confining layer 
separating the strata containing poor-quality water, pollutants, or 
contaminants and the underlying stratum to be protected.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Where two or more strata containing poor-quality water, pollutants, or 
contaminants underlie a stratum to be protected, the annular space opposite 
the stratum to be protected shall be sealed.  The seal shall continue down at 
least 10 feet into, or completely through, whichever is least, the confining 
layer separating the stratum to be protected and the underlying strata 
containing poor-quality water, pollutants or contaminants.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Where two strata containing poor-quality water, pollutants, or 
contaminants are separated by a stratum to be protected, the annular space 
opposite the stratum to be protected, the confining strata underlying and 
overlying the stratum to be protected, and the upper stratum containing poor-quality 
water, pollutants, or contaminants shall be sealed off.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The supplementary seals described in the cases above shall extend up to and 
contact the base of the required minimum annular surface seal described in 
<a href="cpws_section7.html#sec7">Section 7</a> above, if they are otherwise required to be within 10 feet of the 
surface seal.  Sealing the entire annulus above the anode interval will often 
economically fulfill the conditions outlined above.</P>

<P>Requirements for sealing materials and their placement are described in 
<a href="cpws_section7.html#sec7">Section 7</a>, above.</P>

<P id="sec11"><B>Section 11.  Repair of Cathodic Protection Wells.</B></P>

<P>Materials used for repairing cathodic protection well casing shall meet the 
requirements of <a href="#sec9">Section 9</a>, above.</P>

<P id="sec12"><B>Section 12.  Temporary Cover.</B></P>

<P>The well or borehole opening and any associated excavations shall be covered 
at the surface to prevent the entry of foreign material, water, pollutants, 
and contaminants, and to ensure public safety whenever work is interrupted by 
such events as overnight shutdown, poor weather and required waiting periods 
to allow setting of sealing materials and the performance of tests.  The 
cover shall be held in place or weighted down in such a manner that it cannot 
be removed except by equipment or tools.</P>
