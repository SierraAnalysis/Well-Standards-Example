<P id="sec7"><B>Section 7.  Sealing the Upper Annular Space.</B></P>

<P>The space between the cathodic protection well casing and the wall of the 
well boring, often referred to as the "annular space," shall be effectively 
sealed to prevent it from being a preferential pathway for the movement of 
poor-quality water, pollutants, or contaminants.  In some cases, secondary 
purposes of the annular seal are to stabilize the borehole wall, protect 
casing from degradation or corrosion, and ensure the structural integrity of 
the casing.</P>

<P>General discussion of sealing requirements and methods is contained in 
<a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec9.html">Section 9</a> and <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec13.html">Section 13</a> of the Water Well Standards and <a href="../b74-81appendixb.html">Appendix B</a> (Bulletin 74-81). 
Special requirements for sealing cathodic protection wells are:</P>


<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Minimum Depth of Annular Seal.</I>
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI><I>Minimum Depth.</I>  The annular space shall be filled with appropriate 
sealing material from ground surface to a depth of at least 20 feet below 
land surface.  The annular space shall be sealed to a depth of at least 50 
feet below land surface in congested urban areas, or where a cathodic 
protection well is within 100 feet of any potential source of pollution or 
contamination.  Additional annular sealing material shall be installed to 
greater depths where adverse conditions exist that increase the risk of 
pollution or contamination of groundwater.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Fill.</I>  Any annular space existing between the base of the annular surface 
seal and the top of the anode and conductive fill interval shall be filled 
with appropriate fill or sealing material.  Fill material should consist of 
washed granular material such as sand, pea gravel, or sealing material.  Fill 
material shall not be subject to decomposition or consolidation after 
placement and shall be free of pollutants and contaminants.  Fill material 
shall not contain drill cuttings or drilling mud.  Sealing material is often 
more practical and economical to use for filling the annular space than 
granular material.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Sealing-Off Strata.</I>  Additional annular sealing material shall be placed 
below the minimum depth of the annular surface seal, as needed, to prevent 
the movement of poor-quality water, pollutants, and contaminants through the 
well to zones of good-quality water.  Requirements for sealing off zones are 
in Section 10, below.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Sealing Conditions.</I>  Requirements for sealing the annular space under 
varied conditions are detailed in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec9.html#subb">Section 9, Subsection B of the Water Well 
Standards</a>.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Radial Thickness of Seal.</I>  A minimum of 2 inches of sealing material 
shall be maintained between all casings and the borehole wall within the 
interval to be sealed, except where temporary conductor casing cannot be 
removed as noted in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec9.html">Section 9 of the Water Well Standards</a>. 
At least 2 inches of sealing material shall be maintained between all casings in a borehole, 
within the interval to be sealed unless otherwise approved by the enforcing 
agency.  Additional space shall be provided, where needed, to allow casings 
to be properly centralized and spaced and allow the use of a tremie pipe 
during well construction (if required), especially for deeper wells.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Sealing Material.</I>  Sealing material shall consist of neat cement, sand-cement, concrete, or bentonite clay as discussed in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec9.html">Section 9 of the Water 
Well Standards</a>.  Cement-based sealing material shall be used opposite zones 
of fractured rock used.  Concrete shall only be used at the approval of the 
enforcing agency.  Drill cuttings and used drilling mud shall not be used as 
any part of sealing material.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Placement of Seal.</I>  Standards for the placement of annular seals are 
described in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec9.html">Section 9 of the Water Well Standards</a> and <a href="../b74-81appendixb.html">Appendix B</a> (Bulletin 74-81).</LI>
