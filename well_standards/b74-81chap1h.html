<P><CENTER><B>Comments and Public Hearings on Draft Edition</B></CENTER>

<P>Where a publication is of general interest or its subject is one on which 
there can be a diversity of opinion, it is the policy of the Department of 
Water Resources to issue it in preliminary form and solicit comments from 
interested organizations and individuals and the general public.  Since the 
standards for the construction of wells and the destruction of abandoned 
wells recommended herein are for application throughout the State, and 
because they are specified by many counties and cities (in ordinances or 
regulations), a draft edition was prepared and distributed for comment (April 
14, 1981).  In addition, four public hearings or meetings (of an informal 
nature) were held to obtain the views of persons interested in, or concerned 
with, the construction and use of water wells.  These hearings were conducted 
in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Health Services</a> represented by its 
Sanitary Engineering Section since this report contains provisions which 
pertain to the public health aspects of water well construction.  The 
hearings were held during June 1981 at Berkeley, Fresno, Redding, and Los 
Angeles.  In response to a number of requests, the comment period was 
extended to September 1981.

<P>Fifty-five persons representing 33 individuals and organizations attended the 
four hearings.  Five formal (written) statements were presented and 16 
persons commented verbally.  In addition, written comments were received from 
33 other organizations and individuals.  Those submitting written comments 
are listed in Table 5.  Copies of the written comments are available for 
inspection in the Department's file in Sacramento.

<P>All comments were carefully reviewed and considered.  As might be expected, 
opinions differed on the applicability of certain standards, guidelines, and 
procedures.  There is, of course, some validity in each point-of-view, which 
forms the basis for reconsideration.  Many comments were incorporated in this 
final draft.  Others were not used for various reasons.  Most of the comments 
dealt mainly with (1) the standards in Chapter II (following) more 
specifically Sections 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 21 and 23; (2) the Design and 
Performance Guidelines section of this chapter; and (3) Appendixes B, C and 
D, which deal with methods and procedures.
