<P><CENTER>APPENDIX C</CENTER>

<P><CENTER><B>SUGGESTED PROCEDURES FOR DISINFECTED WELLS</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Disinfection of all wells is recommended to eliminate pathogenic organisms as 
well as organisms that can grow in wells and thereby cause clogging and 
effect the quality of water produced.  Disinfection of the well is the final 
act of well construction or repair before it is placed in service.  Wells 
should also be disinfected following repair or replacement of the pump and/or 
well maintenance.  The procedures described in this appendix are recommended 
for disinfecting wells; however, other methods may be used provided it can be 
demonstrated that they will yield comparable results.  For new wells, 
disinfection should take place following development (this will assure that 
the well is purged of drilling mud, dirt, and other debris that reduces the 
effectiveness of the disinfection), testing for yield, and installation of 
the pump.  When there is a delay in pump installation, interim or partial 
disinfection should be undertaken.</P>

<P>Disinfection involves seven steps:</P>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>A chlorine solution containing at least 50 mg/l (or parts per million) 
available chlorine, is added to the well.  Table 6 lists quantities of 
various chloride compounds required to dose 100 feet of water-filled casing at 50 mg/l for diameters ranging from 2 to 24 inches.
  For wells that have been repaired or when a pump has been 
repaired or replaced and, bringing the well back into service quickly is 
desired, the solution should contain at least 100 mg/l available chlorine.  
To obtain this concentration, double the amounts shown in Table 6.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The pump column or drop pipe shall be washed with the chlorine solution 
as it is lowered into the well.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>After it has been placed into position, the pump shall be turned on and 
off several times (i.e., “surged”) so as to thoroughly mix the disinfectant 
with the water in the well.  Pump until the water discharged has the odor of 
chlorine.  Repeat this procedure several times at one-hour intervals.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The well shall be allowed to stand without pumping for 24 hours.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The water shall then be pumped to waste until the presence of chlorine is 
no longer detectable.  The absence of chlorine is best determined by testing 
for available chlorine residual using a test kit designed for this purpose.
<A HREF="javascript:newWindow27()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 27</SUP></FONT></A>

<P>Disposal of the waste should be away from trees, shrubs, or lawns and into 
storm sewers, drainage ditches, etc.  Note that heavily chlorinated water 
should not be wasted into the plumbing system of homes that utilize 
individual sewage disposal systems (septic tanks).  Such strong disinfectants 
could neutralize the bacteria needed to stabilize the sewage and also could 
damage the soil adsorption system.</P></LI>

<LI>A bacteriological sample shall be taken and submitted to a laboratory for 
examination (see <a href="b74-81appendixd.html">Appendix D</a>).</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>If the laboratory analysis shows the water is not free of bacterial 
contamination, the disinfection procedure should be repeated.  Depending on 
the level of contamination, it may be necessary to use a higher concentration 
chlorine solution (several times that shown in Table 6).  The water should 
then be retested.  If repeated attempts to disinfect the well are 
unsuccessful, a detailed investigation to determine the cause of the 
contamination should be undertaken.

<P>Where small individual domestic wells to be treated are of unknown depth or 
volume, at least one pound (0.45 kilograms) of calcium hypochlorite (70 
percent available chlorine) or two gallons (7.5 litres) of household bleach 
(sodium hypochlorite), such as Clorox or Purex, may be used in lieu of the 
chemicals shown in Table 6.</P></LI>

 Note that dry chlorine should <I>always</I> be added to water, not vice versa.
 Further, the chemical should be added slowly.
