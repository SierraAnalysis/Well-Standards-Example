<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Cathodic Protection Well.</I>  A cathodic protection well is defined in 
Section 13711 of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water Code</a> as:
  
<BLOCKQUOTE>". . . any artificial excavation in excess of 50 feet constructed by any 
method for the purpose of installing equipment or facilities for the 
protection electrically of metallic equipment in contact with the ground, 
commonly referred to as cathodic protection."</BLOCKQUOTE></LI>

<LI><I>Enforcing Agency.</I>  An agency designated by duly authorized local, 
regional, or State government to administer and enforce laws or ordinances 
pertaining to the construction, alteration, maintenance, and destruction of 
cathodic protection wells.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Casing.</I>  All vent pipe, anode access tubing, electrical cable conduit, 
and other tubular materials that pass through the interval to be sealed.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Conductor Casing.</I>  A tubular retaining structure temporarily or 
permanently installed in the upper portion of the well boring between the 
wall of the well boring and the inner well casing.  Conductor casing is often 
installed to keep the borehole open during drilling if caving conditions are 
expected.  Despite its title, conductor casing does not normally serve an 
"electrical" function for cathodic protection wells.</LI>
</OL>

<P id=2><B>Section 2.  Exemptions Due to Unusual Conditions.</B></P>

<P>Under certain circumstances the enforcing agency may waive compliance with 
these standards and prescribe alternate requirements.  These standards may be 
waived only where they are impractical or ineffective because of unusual 
conditions, or would result in unsatisfactory condition or well function.  In 
waiving any of these standards, the enforcing agency shall, if at all 
possible, require that measures be implemented to provide the same or greater 
level of water-quality protection that would otherwise be provided by these 
standards.</P>

<P id=3><B>Section 3.  Special Standards.</B></P>

<P>The enforcing agency may prescribe measures more stringent than standards 
described here, where needed to protect public safety or protect water 
quality.</P>

<P id=4><B>Section 4.  Responsible Parties.</B></P>

<P>Corrosion control engineers are normally responsible for the design and 
supervision of corrosion control facilities incorporating cathodic protection 
wells.  Pursuant to Section 13750.5 (Division 7, Chapter 10, Article 3) of 
the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water Code</a>, construction, alteration, and destruction of 
cathodic protection wells shall be performed by contractors licensed in 
accordance with the California Contractors' License Law (Division 3, Chapter 
9, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=bpc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Business and Professions Code</a>), except where exempted by law.  
Above-ground electrical facilities for cathodic protection wells should be 
installed by an appropriately licensed contractor.</P>

<P id=5><B>Section 5.  Reports.</B></P>

<P>Cathodic protection well construction, alteration, and destruction reports 
shall be completed on forms provided by the California Department of Water 
Resources.  Other types of forms may be used for submission to the Department 
with the prior approval of the Department.  The completed forms shall be 
submitted to the Department in accordance with relevant provisions of 
Sections 13750 through 13754 (Division 7, Chapter 10, Article 3) of the 
<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water Code</a>.  Information concerning completion and submission of 
well construction, alteration, and destruction reports is contained in "<a href="../../publications/wcr_instruction_pamphlet.pdf" target=_blank>How to Fill Out a Well Completion Report</a>", Department of Water 
Resources, November 1999. This pamphlet is available in PDF format <FONT SIZE=-1>(646KB)</FONT> and can be viewed with <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html" target="_blank">Adobe Acrobat Reader</A>.
