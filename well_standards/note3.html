<P><FONT size=-1>The uniformity coefficient is a ratio that describes the variation in 
grain size of granular aquifer material. It is defined as the ratio of the particle size of 
a material at which 60 percent of the particles are finer and 40 percent are coarser 
(called D<sub>40</sub>) to the "effective" grain size (i.e., the particle size of the material 
at which ten percent of the particles are finer and 90 percent are coarser (D<sub>90</sub>). 
The value of the uniformity coefficient for a material of one grain size is unity; for a 
heterogenouus sand it might be 30.</FONT>
