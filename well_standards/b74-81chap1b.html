<P><CENTER><B>Statement of the Problem</B></CENTER>

<P>Wells themselves do not cause groundwater quality to deteriorate.  Rather, it 
is inadequate construction, or, in the case of wells that no longer serve a 
useful purpose, their improper destruction, that can result in the 
deterioration of groundwater quality.  Depending on the circumstances, such 
quality deterioration may affect the water supplying a single well, or if the 
pollution is substantial, a sizable segment of a groundwater basin.

<P>The impairment of water quality in an individual well, or group of wells, is 
the most common.  Groundwater supplies have been responsible for a sizable 
portion of the water-borne disease outbreaks reported in the United States.  
Most of these outbreaks occurred where wells were so poorly constructed that 
they allowed contaminants to enter the well.  Contaminants entering 
improperly constructed wells are not limited to disease organisms.  There is 
also a growing number of case histories concerning undesirable chemicals, 
both toxic and nontoxic, that have gained access to groundwater and adversely 
affected wells a short distance away.

<P>The mechanism of water quality impairment caused by faulty wells affecting 
large segments of a groundwater basin is not well defined.  In most instances, 
a number of factors have been involved; the wells have served primarily to 
facilitate the impairment.  The most noteworthy examples in California of 
widespread water quality deterioration are in coastal groundwater basins that 
have been subjected to seawater intrusion.

<P>Inadequately constructed or improperly "abandoned" wells are not the sole 
cause of water quality degradation in a California groundwater basin.  A 
small quantity of contaminants entering one well may not have far-reaching 
effect.  However, (1) the construction of thousands of new wells in 
California each year, (2) the fact that many are becoming more closely 
spaced, and (3) the growing number of wells being neglected or 
indiscriminately abandoned indicate that the potential for impairing 
groundwater quality is growing.  Then, when pollutants move along the lines 
of natural water movement, the effects will be long-lasting and difficult, if 
not impossible, to correct.

<P><IMG SRC="figures/74-81fig1.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=530 ALT="Figure 1">
Inadequately constructed or improperly destroyed wells facilitate the 
impairment of groundwater quality (see Figures 1 and 2) in five principal 
ways:

<P>1. When the well is located too close to sources of pollution or 
contamination or downstream from them so that the well can be directly 
affected by flow from these sources (Figure 1A).  Ironically, sometimes the 
source of pollution is a nearby abandoned well.

<P>2. When the surface portion of the well is constructed without protective 
features so that contaminated or polluted waters can flow directly into the 
well through one or more of several possible openings in or under the pump.  
Usually under these circumstances only the water in or adjacent to the well 
is affected (Figures 1B and 1C).

<P>3. When the annular space (the space between the outside of the casing 
and the wall of the hole) lacks an adequate vertical seal and surface water 
or shallow subsurface water flows into the well along the outside of the casing.  
(Note that although the annular space may be filled with granular filter material, 
i.e., the familiar "gravel-pack", no seal exists and undesirable water can move 
downward or laterally.)  This type of defective well is particularly susceptible 
(Figure 1D) to contamination. 

<P>4. When, during well construction (or the destruction of abandoned wells), 
aquifers that produce poor quality water are ineffectively sealed off, allowing 
the interchange of water with one or more aquifers and thus significantly impairing 
the quality of water in those aquifers.  The well now provides a physical connection 
between these aquifers (Figure 2). 

<P><IMG SRC="figures/74-81fig2.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=535 ALT="Figure 2">
5. When the well is used intentionally, accidentally, or carelessly for the 
disposal of waste allowing direct contamination of the groundwater to occur.  Such 
disposal is prohibited by law except under specially approved circumstances.

<P>Irrespective of the probability of occurrence and which form of deterioration 
takes place, wells should be constructed or destroyed such that they do not 
contribute to the impairment of the quality of California's groundwater 
supplies.  Moreover, while the well construction industry, advisory groups, 
and regulatory agencies want to protect the quality of the State's 
groundwater supplies as well as assure that wells are adequately constructed, 
there is no broad, uniform approach for so doing in California.  The 
resolution of this problem requires the development of standards for water 
well construction and destruction that will ensure the protection of the 
State's groundwater as they exist in the ground or as they pass through the 
well for use.  Such standards should be capable of execution by the average 
competent well driller using commercially available equipment and materials, 
without imposing undue financial burden on the well owner.

<P>Well standards do more than protect the quality of the groundwater resource; 
they also provide a degree of consumer protection.  When standards are 
established and implemented in an area, well owners have more assurance that 
their wells will be constructed properly.  Proper construction could mean 
less maintenance with an extended well life.  Most well owners do not realize 
that deficiencies in design and construction (including failure to close-off 
access to pollutants described above) are likely to result in higher 
operating and maintenance costs.

<P>A subject touched upon earlier is the safety hazard posed by the unused or 
"abandoned" well.  While safety is not a matter involving the maintenance of 
groundwater quality, it should be a concern to all those involved with water 
wells.  Any abandoned excavation is a threat to the safety of people, 
especially children and animals.  Further, State law (Section 24400 of the 
<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=hsc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Health and Safety Code</a>) requires that abandoned excavations be 
fenced, covered, or filled.  Yet, children (and sometimes adults) and 
livestock do fall into abandoned wells and other excavations.

<P>By properly destroying abandoned wells, we can easily eliminate this safety 
hazard.
