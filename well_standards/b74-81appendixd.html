<P><CENTER><B>COLLECTION OF WATER QUALITY SAMPLES</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Water from all new wells should be sampled in order to determine the quality 
of the water that is being produced.  The type of analysis that will be made 
is dependent on the expected use of the water.  For example, individual 
domestic wells should be sampled for determination of bacterial quality and 
chemical quality.  The water from agricultural wells is generally examined 
only for the presence of specific chemicals unless there is the likelihood 
that there will be incidental domestic use of the water, in which case the 
bacterial quality ought to be determined too.</P>

<P>Recommendations regarding the types of analyses to be performed for the 
various uses of water will be found in numerous references on water quality 
and groundwater; however, it is best to consult with local agencies such as 
county farm advisors, health departments or water service agencies 
(irrigation or water districts).  Sampling of community water supply wells is 
covered by requirements of the California <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Health Services</a>.

<CENTER><B>Bacterial Sampling</B></CENTER>

<P>For individual domestic wells, technical advice regarding the collection of 
bacteriological samples may be obtained from the local health departments or 
from the laboratories that will examine the sample.  If no technical 
assistance is available, the following procedure will suffice:  A sterile 
sample bottle, preferably one provided by the laboratory, must be used.  It 
is extremely important that nothing except the water to be analyzed come in 
contact with the inside of the bottle or the cap; the water must not be 
allowed to flow over an object or over the hands and into the bottle while it 
is being filled.  If the water is collected from a sample tap, turn on the 
tap and allow the water to flow for 2 or 3 minutes before collecting the 
sample.<A HREF="javascript:newWindow29()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 29</SUP></FONT></A>
  Do not rinse the sample bottle.  The sample should be delivered to 
the laboratory as soon as possible and in no case more than 30 hours after 
its collection.  During delivery, the sample should be kept as cool as 
possible (but not frozen).</P>  

<CENTER><B>Chemical Sampling</B></CENTER>

<P>Generally, a routine mineral analyses (determination of the concentrations of 
the common minerals such as calcium, sodium, chloride, sulfate, etc.) plus 
analyses for selected minor elements will suffice, particularly where there 
is no prior knowledge of the chemical quality of the water in the area where 
the well is located.  Where quality 
conditions in the surrounding area are known, a more selective analysis may 
be made.  For specified uses it may also be desirable to make analysis for 
concentrations of certain constituents (such as iron and manganese in the 
case of domestic water or boron in irrigation water).  Organic chemicals are 
not routinely determined.  Information or advice on chemical quality 
conditions may be obtained from local agencies such as the county farm 
advisors, health departments, etc.</P>

<P>The sample should be collected after the well has been pumped long enough to 
remove standing water and development and disinfectant chemicals, and to 
ensure that water from the producing formation(s) has entered the well.  The 
water sample should be collected in a chemically clean container, preferably 
one obtained from the laboratory that will perform the analysis.  The 
container should be rinsed several times with the water to be sampled prior 
to collecting the sample.  The laboratory performing the analysis should 
issue instructions regarding the quantity of sample required and whether or 
not preservatives are needed.  However, one-half gallon (1.9 litres) is 
usually sufficient for a routine mineral analysis; one gallon (3.8 litres) 
when analyses for minor elements (i.e., iron, manganese, etc.) is also 
required.  Sample quantities for organic chemicals vary according to the type 
of analysis, and range from very small amounts up to several gallons 
(litres).  In addition, where organic chemicals are to be determined, special 
sampling procedures and equipment may be required.  This is particularly true 
for volatile organic compounds.</P>

<P>In all cases the temperature of the water should be determined immediately 
upon collection of the sample.</P>
