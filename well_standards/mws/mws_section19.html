<P><B>Section 19.  Requirements for Destroying Monitoring Wells and Exploration 
Holes.</B></P>

<P>General requirements for destroying monitoring wells and exploration holes 
are contained in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec23.html">Section 23 of the Water Well Standards</a>. 
Special considerations for monitoring wells and exploration holes are as follows:</P>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Monitoring Wells.</I>  Monitoring wells shall be destroyed in accordance with 
the following requirements and <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec23.html">Section 23 of the Water Well Standards</a>, 
irrespective of their original date of construction:
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI><I>Preliminary Work.</I>  A monitoring well shall be investigated before it is 
destroyed to determine its condition and details of its construction.  The 
well shall be sounded immediately before it is destroyed to make sure no 
obstructions exist that will interfere with filing and sealing.

<P>The well shall be cleaned before destruction as needed so that all 
undesirable materials, including obstructions to filling and sealing, debris, 
oil from oil-lubricated pumps, or pollutants and contaminants that could 
interfere with well destruction, are removed for disposal.</P>

<P>The enforcing agency shall be notified as soon as possible if pollutants or 
contaminants are known or suspected to be present in a well to be destroyed.  
Well destruction operations may then proceed only at the approval of the 
enforcing agency.  The enforcing agency should be contacted to determine 
requirements for proper disposal of all materials removed from a well to be 
destroyed.</P>

<LI><I>Sealing Conditions.</I>  The following minimum requirements shall be followed 
when various conditions are encountered:
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>The monitoring well casing, and any other significant voids within the 
well, shall, at a minimum, be completely filled with sealing material, if the 
following conditions exist:
<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>The monitoring well is located in an area of known or potential pollution or 
contamination, and,</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The well was constructed and maintained in accordance with these standards.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Sealing material may have to be placed under pressure to ensure that the 
monitoring well is properly filled and sealed.</P>

<LI>A monitoring well shall be destroyed by removing all material within the 
original borehole, including the well casing, filter pack, and annular seal; 
and the created hole completely filled with appropriate sealing material, if 
the following conditions exist:
<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>The well is located in an area of known or potential pollution or 
contamination, and,</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>The well's annular seal, casing, screen, filter pack, or other components 
were not constructed or maintained according to these standards so that well 
destruction be merely filling the well casing with sealing material, as in 
"a" above, would not prevent potential water-quality degradation from the 
movement of poor-quality water, pollutants, or contaminants through the 
destroyed well structure.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Material to be extracted from the original borehole shall be removed by means 
of drilling, including overdrilling, if necessary.  The enforcing agency 
should be contacted to determine requirements for proper disposal of removed 
materials.</P>

<P>Casing, filter pack, and annular seal materials may be left in place during 
sealing operations, if the enforcing agency agrees they cannot or should not 
be removed.  In such a case, appropriate sealing material shall be placed in 
the well casing, filter pack, and all other significant voids within the 
entire well boring.  Casing left in place may require perforation or 
puncturing to allow proper placement of sealing materials.  Sealing material 
may have to be applied under pressure to ensure its proper distribution.</P>

<LI>Monitoring wells shall, at a minimum, be destroyed in accordance with the 
requirements of <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec23.html">Section 23 of the Water Well Standards</a> if located in an area 
free of any known or potential contamination or pollution.</LI>
</OL></OL>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Exploratory Borings.</I>  Exploratory borings shall be completely filled with 
appropriate sealing material from bottom to top, if located in areas of known 
or suspected contamination or pollution.  Borings located outside such areas 
shall, at a minimum, be filled with sealing material from ground surface to 
the minimum depths specified in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec23.html">Section 23 of the Water Well standards</a>.  
Additional sealing material shall be placed below the minimum surface seal 
where needed to prevent the interchange if poor-quality water, pollutants, or 
contaminants between strata penetrated by the boring.</P>

<P>Appropriate fill or sealing material shall be placed below and between 
intervals containing sealing material.  Sealing material is often economical 
to use as fill material.</P>

<P>The boring shall be inspected immediately prior to filling and sealing 
operations.  All obstructions and pollutants and contaminants that could 
interfere with filling and sealing operations shall be removed prior to 
filling and sealing.  The enforcing agency shall be notified as soon as 
possible if pollutants or contaminants are known or suspected to be in a 
boring to be destroyed.  Well destruction operations may then proceed only at 
the approval of the enforcing agency.  The enforcing agency should be 
contacted to determine requirements for proper disposal of removed materials.</P>

<LI><I>Placement of Material.</I>  The placement of sealing material for monitoring 
wells and exploratory borings is generally described in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec23.html">Section 23 of the Water Well Standards</a> and 
<a href="../b74-81appendixb.html">Appendix B (Bulletin 74-81)</a>.  The following additional 
requirements shall be observed when placing sealing material for monitoring 
well or exploratory boring destruction.
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI><I>Placement Method.</I>  The well or exploratory boring shall be filled with 
appropriate sealing, and fill material where allowed, using a tremie pipe or 
equivalent, proceeding upward from the bottom of the well or boring.

<P>Sealing material shall be placed by methods (such as the use of a tremie pipe 
or equivalent) that prevent freefall, bridging, and dilution of sealing 
materials, and/or prevent separation of aggregate from sealants.  Sealing 
material may be placed by freefall only where the interval to be sealed is 
dry and no more than 30 feet in depth.  Fill material shall be placed by 
methods that prevent bridging and voids.</P>

<LI><I>Timing and Placement.</I>  Sealing material shall be placed in one continuous 
operation (or "pour") from the bottom to the top of the well or boring, 
unless conditions in the well or boring dictate that sealing operations be 
conducted in a staged manner, and prior approval is obtained from the 
enforcing agency.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Groundwater Flow.</I>  Special care shall be used to restrict the flow of 
groundwater into a well or boring while placing sealing and fill material, if 
subsurface pressure producing the flow is significant.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Sealing Pressure.</I>  Pressure required for the placement of cement-based 
sealing materials shall be maintained long enough for cement-based sealing 
materials to properly set.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Verification.</I>  It shall be verified that the volume of sealing and fill 
material placed during destruction operations equals or exceeds the volume to 
be filled and sealed.  This is to help determine whether the well or boring 
has been properly destroyed and that no jamming or bridging of the fill or 
sealing material has occurred.</LI>
</OL>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Sealing and Fill Materials.</I>  Materials used for sealing exploratory 
borings and monitoring wells shall have low permeabilities so that the volume 
of water and possible pollutants and contaminants passing through them will 
be of minimal consequence.  Sealing material shall be compatible with the 
chemical environment into which it is placed, and shall have mechanical 
properties consistent with present and future site uses.

<P>Suitable sealing materials include neat cement, sand-cement, and bentonite, 
all of which are described in <a href="mws_section9.html">Section 9 of these standards</a>.  Bentonite shall 
not be used as a sealing material opposite zones of fractured rock, unless 
otherwise approved by the enforcing agency.  Drilling mud or drill cuttings 
are not acceptable as any part of sealing material for well destruction.  
Concrete may be used as a sealing material at the approval of the enforcing 
agency.</P>

<P>Fill material, if any, shall meet the requirements of <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec23.html">Section 23 of the Water 
Well Standards</a>.  Fill material shall be free of pollutants and contaminants 
and shall not be subject to decomposition or consolidation after placement.  
Drilling mud or cuttings are not acceptable as any part of fill material.</P>

<LI><I>Additional Requirements for Monitoring Wells and Exploratory Borings in 
Urban Areas.</I>  The following additional requirements shall be met for 
destroying wells and exploratory borings in urban areas, unless otherwise 
approved by the enforcing agency:
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>The upper surface of the sealing material shall end at the depth of 5 
feet below ground surface; and,</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>If the well casing was not extracted during destruction and sealing 
operations, a hole shall be excavated around the well casing to a depth of 5 
feet below ground surface after sealing operations have been completed and 
the sealing material has adequately set and cured.  The exposed well casing 
shall then be removed by cutting the casing at the bottom of the excavation.  
The excavation shall be backfilled with clean, native soil or other suitable 
material.</LI>          
</OL>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Temporary Cover.</I>  The well or borehole opening and any associated 
excavations shall be covered at the surface to ensure public safety and to 
prevent the entry of foreign material, water, pollutants, and contaminants; 
whenever work is interrupted by such events as overnight shutdown, poor 
weather, and required waiting periods to allow setting of sealing materials 
and the performance of tests.  The cover shall be held in place or weighted 
down in such a manner that it cannot be removed, except by equipment or 
tools.</LI>
