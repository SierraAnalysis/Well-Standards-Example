<P>Certain standards that apply to water wells also apply to monitoring wells.  
Therefore the Monitoring Well Standards refer frequently to the <a href="../wws/wws_combined.html">Water Well 
Standards</a>.  Standards that apply only to monitoring wells, or that require 
emphasis, are discussed in detail in the Monitoring Well Standards.  The 
Monitoring Well Standards are arranged in a format similar to the <a href="../wws/wws_combined.html">Water Well 
Standards</a>.</P>

<P>These standards are not intended as a complete manual for monitoring well 
construction, alteration, maintenance, and destruction.  These standards 
serve only as minimum statewide guidelines towards ensuring that monitoring 
wells do not constitute a significant pathway for the movement of poor 
quality water, pollutants, or contaminants.  These standards provide no 
assurance that a monitoring well will perform a desired function.  In most 
cases groundwater monitoring practices and monitoring well performance, or 
functional requirements, fall under the purview of the various agencies 
mentioned earlier.  <I>Ultimate responsibility for the design and performance of 
a monitoring well rests with the well owner and/or the owner's contractor, 
and/or technical representative(s).</I></P>
