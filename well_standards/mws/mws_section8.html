<P><B>Section 8.  Well Location With Respect to Pollutants and Contaminants, and 
Structures.</B></P>

<P>Monitoring wells are usually constructed to observe conditions at defined or 
required locations.  Monitoring well locations are usually selected on the 
basis of known or expected hydrologic, geologic, and water quality conditions 
and the location of pollutant or contaminant sources.  Monitoring wells 
frequently need to be located close to or within areas of pollution or 
contamination.</P>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Separation.</I>  Monitoring wells shall be located an adequate distance from 
known or potential sources of pollution and contamination, including those 
listed in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec8.html">Section 8 of the Water Well Standards</a>, unless regulatory or 
legitimate data requirements necessitate they be located closer.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Flooding and Drainage.</I>  Monitoring wells should be located in areas 
protected from flooding, if possible.  Provisions for locating monitoring 
wells in areas of flooding and drainage are contained in <a href="../wws/wws_combined_sec8.html">Section 8 of the 
Water Well Standards</a>.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Accessibility.</I>  All monitoring wells shall be located an adequate 
distance from buildings and other structures to allow access for well 
maintenance, modification, repair, and destruction, unless otherwise approved 
by the enforcing agency.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Disposal of Wastes When Drilling in Contaminated or Polluted Areas.</I>  
Drill cuttings and wastewater from monitoring wells or exploration holes in 
areas of known or suspected contamination or pollution shall be disposed of 
in accordance with all applicable federal, State, and local requirements.  
The enforcing agency should be contacted to determine requirements for the 
proper disposal of cuttings and wastewater.</LI>
