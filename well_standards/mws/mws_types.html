<P><CENTER><B>Types of Monitoring Wells</B></CENTER></P>

<P>For the purpose of these standards, the term "monitoring well" is limited to 
wells designed to monitor subsurface water in the saturated zone, existing at 
or above atmospheric pressure (groundwater); rather than water, water vapor, 
and/or gases contained in the unsaturated or vadose zone. Monitoring devices 
used for the unsaturated zone differ significantly from those used for the 
saturated (groundwater) zone.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../figures/74-90fig2.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=444 ALT="Figure 2">
As shown in Figure 2, three basic types of monitoring wells or 
"installations" are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Individual monitoring wells;</LI>

<LI>Nested monitoring wells; and,</LI>

<LI>Clustered monitoring wells.</LI>
</UL>


<P>Individual monitoring wells consist of a single casing "string" within a 
borehole, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.  Individual monitoring wells are 
installed in unique locations apart from one another.  They are the most 
common type of monitoring well constructed in California.</P>

<P>Nested monitoring wells consist of two or more casing strings within the same 
borehole.  Normally the screened interval of each casing string is designed 
to obtain water from different aquifers or water-bearing zones.  The purpose 
of a nested monitoring well is much the same as clustered monitoring wells.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../figures/74-90fig3.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=446 ALT="Figure 3">
Clustered monitoring wells consist of individual monitoring wells situated 
close together, but not in the same borehole.  The wells within a cluster are 
normally constructed to obtain water from different aquifers or water-bearing 
zones.  Clustered wells are most often used for monitoring groundwater 
conditions at various depths in roughly the same area.</P>

<P>A nested monitoring well can be difficult to construct because of multiple 
casings within the same borehole.  Care is required during construction to 
ensure water-bearing zones for each casing string are hydraulically isolated 
from one another and the annular seals are effective.  Some regulatory 
agencies may prohibit the use of nested monitoring wells for certain 
contamination or pollution investigations.  Normally this can be due to 
uncertainties about whether water-bearing strata can be isolated and whether 
the annular seals in a nested well are always effective.</P>

<P>Individual casing strings for the various types of monitoring wells discussed 
above, are sometimes designed to obtain water from more than one aquifer or 
water-bearing unit.  These casing strings usually have multiple intervals of 
openings or screen.  Such well casing strings, often referred to as "multi-level monitoring wells," can sometimes serve as a preferential pathway for 
the movement of poor quality water, pollutants, and contaminants from one 
unit to another.  Some regulatory agencies prohibit the use of multi-level 
monitoring wells for certain pollution or contamination investigations out of 
concern for water quality protection and data quality requirements.</P>
