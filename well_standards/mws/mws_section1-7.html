<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Monitoring Well.</I>  The term "monitoring well" is defined in Section 13712 
of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water Code</a> as:</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"…any artificial excavation by any method for the purpose of monitoring 
fluctuations in groundwater levels, quality of underground waters, or the 
concentration of contaminants in underground waters."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><I>Exploration Hole (or Boring).</I>  An uncased temporary excavation whose 
purpose is the immediate determination of hydrologic conditions at a site.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Enforcing Agency.</I>  An agency designated by duly authorized local, 
regional, or State government to administer and enforce laws or ordinances 
pertaining to the construction, alteration, maintenance, and destruction of 
monitoring wells.</LI>
</OL>

<P id=sec2><B>Section 2.  Application to Well Type.</B></P>

<P>These standards apply to all types of monitoring wells, except as prescribed 
in Sections 3, 4, and 5, below.  Before a change in use of a well is made, 
any standards for the new use must be complied with.</P>

<P id=sec3><B>Section 3.  Exemptions for Unusual Conditions.</B></P>

<P>Under certain circumstances the enforcing agency may waive compliance with 
these standards and prescribe alternate requirements.  These standards may be 
waived where they are impractical or ineffective because of unusual 
conditions or would result in an unsatisfactory condition or well function.  
In waving any of these standards the enforcing agency shall, if at all 
possible, require measures be implemented to provide the same or greater 
level of water-quality protection that would otherwise be provided by these 
standards.</P>

<P id=sec4><B>Section 4.  Exclusions.</B></P>

<P>Most standards in <a href="mws_section8.html">Part II, "Monitoring Well Construction"</a>, do not 
apply to "exploration holes."  However, provisions of <a href="#sec7">Section 7, "Reports"</a>, 
below and <a href="mws_section16-18.html">Part III, "Destruction of Monitoring Wells"</a>, do apply 
directly to exploration holes.</P>

<P>Exploration holes for determining suitability of on-site domestic sewage 
disposal that are less than 10 feet in depth are exempt from the reporting 
and destruction requirements of these standards.</P>

<P>Large volume excavations for determining the suitability of on-site domestic 
sewage disposal, such as backhoe trenches, that exceed ten feet in depth are 
exempt from the requirements of <a href="mws_section16-18.html">Part III</a> of these standards.  However, such 
excavations shall be backfilled with the excavated material or other suitable 
fill material and the backfill compacted in lifts to attain at least 90 
percent relative compaction in order to restore physical conditions in the 
excavation as much as possible.  If a layer or layers of material that serve 
to impede the movement of poor-quality water, pollutants and contaminants are 
penetrated by the excavation, they shall be reestablished to the degree 
possible to provide protection for underground waters, unless otherwise 
approved by enforcing agency.  In some cases it may be necessary to backfill 
all or a portion of the excavation with sealing material meeting these 
standards to reestablish natural barriers to the movement of poor-quality 
water, pollutants, and contaminants.</P>

<P id=sec5><B>Section 5.  Special Standards.</B></P>

<P>The enforcing agency may prescribe measures more stringent than standards 
presented here, where needed to protect public safety or protect water 
quality.</P>

<P id=sec6><B>Section 6.  Responsible Parties.</B></P>

<P>Pursuant to Section 13750.5 (Division 7, Chapter 10, Article 3) of the 
<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water Code</a>; construction, alteration, and destruction of 
monitoring wells shall be performed by contractors licensed in accordance 
with the California Contractors' License Law (Division 3, Chapter 9, 
<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=bpc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Business and Professions Code</a>), except where exempted by law.  
Construction, alteration, or destruction of monitoring wells to monitor 
hazardous waste facilities, other waste facilities, or underground storage 
tanks, shall be performed under the supervision of a California Registered 
Professional Engineer, California Registered Geologist, or California 
Certified Engineering Geologist, where specified by law.</P>

<P id=sec7><B>Section 7.  Reports.</B></P>

<P>Monitoring well construction, alteration, and destruction reports shall be 
completed on forms provided by the California Department of Water Resources.  
Other types of forms may be used for submission to the Department with the 
prior approval of the Department.  The completed forms shall be submitted to 
the Department in accordance with relevant provisions of Sections 13750 
through 13754 (Division 7, Chapter 10, Article 3) of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Water 
Code</a>.  Information concerning completion and submission of well construction, 
alteration, and destruction reports is contained in "<a href="../../publications/wcr_instruction_pamphlet.pdf" target=_blank>How to Fill Out a Well Completion Report</a>", Department of Water 
Resources, November 1999. This pamphlet is available in PDF format <FONT SIZE=-1>(646KB)</FONT> and can be viewed with <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html" target="_blank">Adobe Acrobat Reader</A>.</P>
