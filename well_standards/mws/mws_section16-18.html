<P><CENTER><B>Part III.  Destruction of Monitoring Wells</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>Section 16.  Purpose of Destruction.</B></P>

<P>A monitoring well or exploration hole subject to these requirements that is 
no longer useful, permanently inactive or "abandoned" must be properly 
destroyed to:</P>

<P>(1) Ensure the quality of groundwater is protected, and,</P>

<P>(2) Eliminate a possible physical hazard to humans and animals.</P>


<P id=17><B>Section 17.  Definition of "Abandoned" Monitoring Well.</B></P>

<P>A monitoring well is considered "abandoned" or permanently inactive if it has 
not been used for one year, unless the owner demonstrates intention to use 
the well again.  In some cases regulatory agencies may require that an 
inactive monitoring well be maintained for future use.</P>

<P>In accordance with Section 24400 of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=hsc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Health and Safety Code</a>, 
the monitoring well owner shall properly maintain an inactive well, as 
evidence of intention for future use, in such a way that the following 
requirements are met:</P>

<P>"(1)  The well shall not allow impairment of the quality of water within the 
well and groundwater encountered by the well.</P>

<P>(2)  The top of the well or well casing shall be provided with a cover, that 
is secured by a lock or by other means to prevent its removal without the use 
of equipment or tools, to prevent unauthorized access, to prevent safety 
hazard to humans and animals, and to prevent illegal disposal of wastes in 
the well.  The cover shall be watertight where the top of the well casing or 
other surface openings to the well are below ground level, such as in a vault 
or below known levels of flooding.  The cover shall be watertight if the well 
is inactive for more than five consecutive years.  A pump motor, angle drive, 
or other surface feature of a well, when in compliance with the above 
provisions, shall suffice as a cover.</P>

<P>(3)  The well shall be marked so as to be easily visible and located, and 
labeled so as to be easily identified as a well.</P>

<P>(4)  The area surrounding the well shall be kept clear of brush, debris, and 
waste materials."</P>

<P id=18><B>Section 18.  General Requirements</B></P>

<P>All permanently inactive or "abandoned" monitoring wells and exploration 
holes subject to these requirements shall be properly destroyed.  The 
purposes of destruction are to eliminate the well structure and borehole as a 
possible means for the preferential migration of poor-quality water, 
pollutants, and contaminants; and, to prevent a possible hazard to humans and 
animals.</P>
