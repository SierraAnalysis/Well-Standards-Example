<P><CENTER><B>Design and Performance Guidelines</B></CENTER>

<P>While the standards presented here (see Chapter II following) are designed to 
protect the continued utility of the State's groundwater resources, they are 
only incidentally related to the effective use of these resources.  Events of 
the past decade have emphasized the need for conservation of water and 
energy.  Furthermore, consumers (in this case, well owners) have become more 
aware of problems resulting from inefficient operation (as reflected in 
increased energy consumption) and inadequate maintenance.

<P>Accordingly, this section was prepared to provide well owners and drillers 
with guidelines for measuring performance that will lead to the design and 
construction of more efficient wells as well as those requiring less 
maintenance.

<P id="capacity"><B>Testing for Capacity</B>

<P>Every well owner is interested in how much water the well will produce and 
how dependable the production will be with time.  To make that determination 
a capacity test or performance test must be made.  Usually this involves 
installing a pump and operating it at the expected production rate over a 
certain length of time.  There is considerable variation in actual practice 
on how such tests are performed depending on the dimensions of the well, 
including expected capacity and intended use as well as geologic conditions 
at the site.  Obviously, for a small capacity well, i.e., one that produces 
under 50 gallons per minute, the test would not be as elaborate 
as it would be for a high capacity well, but is no less important.

<P>The amount of water needed is determined by the intended use of the water.  
For example, on the average, each person in a household uses 100 gallons  
 of water a day.  To the daily household use must be added seasonal 
uses such a lawn and garden irrigation, swimming pools, etc.  Table 4 lists 
the volume of water supplied from a small capacity well, assuming continuous 
pumping for 24 hours.  Thus, a well supplying one to three gallons  
per minute is a reasonable amount for a single family dwelling.  
Additional amounts, such as for watering livestock or irrigating small 
acreages of crops, must be added to these values.  Table 4 also indicates 
that a family of four could subsist on the water supplied by a well pumping 
constantly at the rate of only one-quarter gallon per minute.  
Unfortunately, at this rate there is little margin for error.

<P><I>Small Capacity Wells</I>.  Performance tests for small capacity wells are 
relatively simple.  A widely used test for small capacity wells is a pump 
test which lasts for four hours or until an apparently stable pumping level
has been achieved at a rate equal to that expected for the permanent pump.  
However, in the hilly and mountainous "hard rock" areas of the State there 
are no defined aquifers and supplies are related to fracture patterns, the 
nature and extent of the soil mantle, faults, changes in stratigraphy, etc.  
In such areas the production potential of a well cannot be accurately 
assessed.  Further, wells in these areas often exhibit a satisfactory initial 
production, which then declines due to poor recharge characteristics of the 
surrounding material.  In such situations a longer than usual test, upwards 
of 12 to 24 hours (and longer) duration, may be desirable.

<P>Bailing or air-blow tests give an approximate indication of production.  They 
do not provide information of the accuracy needed to determine well capacity 
or to design an efficient pump system.  (Air lift testing differs from air-blow testing.
 It involves pumping with air, not blowing the water out of the 
well as is the case with the air-blow test.)

<P>The ability of the water level in a small capacity well to recover should be 
observed.  If the water level fails to return to nearly its original level 
after 24-hours, the reliability of the producing zone is open to question.

<P><I>Large Capacity Wells</I>.  Where large capacity wells are concerned, capacity 
tests are more elaborate and extensive.  Such wells are usually located in 
defined, productive groundwater basins, where considerable information on 
existing conditions is normally available to aid in the evaluation of their 
performance.  All should be pump tested; bailer tests are of little value.  
The test pump should be capable of pumping 125 percent of the desired yield 
of the well.  Pumping should be continued at a uniform rate until the "cone 
of depression" reflects any boundary condition that could affect the 
performance of the well.  This could be as short as six hours and as long as 
several days, depending on aquifer characteristics and knowledge of the 
aquifer(s) in which the well is situated.  The discharge rate and drawdown 
established should be maintained for  specified time period.  The ratio of 
the discharge rate to the drawdown is called the specific capacity of the 
well for that time period.  The units for specific capacity are gallons per 
minute per foot of drawdown.  Static water 
levels must be measured in advance of the test and after the test during 
recovery.

<P>Detailed descriptions of procedures and methods used in conducting pump tests 
for large capacity wells and for analyzing and interpreting the results are 
too lengthy to be included in this publication.  Such information will be 
found in literature on groundwater and on the design of water wells.

<P id="efficiency"><B>Well Efficiency</B>

<P>Well efficiency is defined as the ratio of the theoretical drawdown in the 
formation to the actual drawdown in the well.  The difference between the two 
is caused by frictional energy losses of the water as it moves from within 
the formation to the pump intake.  Thus, well efficiency describes the 
effectiveness of a well in yielding water.  Well efficiency should not be 
confused with pumping-plant (motor and pump) or "wire-to-water" efficiency 
used to measure pumping-plant performance.

<P>It should be obvious that well efficiency is related to the cost of pumping 
and the use of energy.  If efficiency improves, pumping costs and energy 
consumption will drop.  Thus, optimum well design is no less important where 
a small capacity well is concerned than it is for one with a large capacity.  
Unfortunately, design and construction practices that produce efficient wells 
are often sacrificed in order to save on the cost of constructing a well, 
particularly in the case of small capacity wells.  However, the increased 
cost of design and construction can be offset by decreased maintenance and 
operating costs over the long run, although it should be recognized that 
there is a limit to what can be achieved when compared to expenditure.  
Current design and construction technology is capable of producing wells with 
efficiencies of 80 to 90 percent.  Pumping-plant or "wire-to-water" 
efficiency is currently at 65-70 percent.

<P id="sanding"><B>Sanding</B>

<P>Irrespective of size or composition, any loose material entering a well is 
usually called "sand", and wells that regularly produce significant 
quantities of loose material are termed "sanders".  The continued influx of 
sand to a well results in damage to pumps and leads eventually to decreased 
capacity, and thus a reduction in well efficiency.  Further, enough sand may 
pass through the well to create cavities in the aquifer around the intake 
section of the well.  As a result, such cavities can collapse and damage the 
well casing or screen.  While most wells pump a minor amount of sand, 
excessive sanding is usually caused by poor well design or inadequate 
development.

<P><I>Uncased ("Open-bottom") Wells</I>.  Casing serves to hold up the walls of the 
borehole and provide a path for the movement of the water.  In formations 
with material that will not loosen and be carried away by the inflowing 
water, such as crystalline rock and other "hard rock" formations, the 
practice is to leave the intake sections uncased.  (Theoretically in such 
instances, well efficiency would be 100 percent.)  Unfortunately, in certain 
areas some drillers believing the underlying material to be fully 
consolidated or attempting to save on costs, have drilled open-bottom wells 
that later produced sand.  Furthermore, as pumps lowered following declining 
water levels, such wells developed sanding problems.  This occurred in 
several areas in the Central Valley during the 1976-77 drought.  In such 
instances, the wells should have been completely cased to prevent caving and 
the intake section screened to prevent the entrance of sand.

<P><I>Inadequately Designed Intake Sections</I>.  Sanding is often the result of poor 
selection of screen size or perforation dimensions and/or, where used, filter 
material (the "gravel pack").  The well screen aperture (slot) openings or 
the perforated section, should be selected to provide sufficient open area to 
allow the desired quantity of water to enter with minimal friction losses 
while keeping out 90 to 95 percent of the natural aquifer material or filter 
material.

<P>Artificial filter materials perform a similar function.  In addition to 
allowing the water to enter the well openings and preventing the entrance of 
fine-grained material, artificial filters are also used to increase the 
effective diameter of the well and increase the yield of certain wells by 
allowing numerous thin aquifers to produce water.  On the other hand they 
need not be used unless there are conditions that make their use desirable or 
necessary. Artificial filters are desirable when the aquifer has a "uniformity 
coefficient"<A HREF="javascript:newWindow3()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 3</SUP></FONT></A>
 of less than 2.5 (some authorities recommend a value of less 
than 3), or in poorly consolidated rock, i.e., rock that tends to cave when 
pumping occurs.

<P>Detailed information on the design of intake sections, including the 
selection of well screen aperture openings and artificial filter materials, 
will be found in most publications dealing with groundwater and water wells, 
a number of which are listed in <a href="b74-81appendixe.html">Appendix E</a>.

<P><I>Incomplete Development</I>.  Well construction causes compaction of 
unconsolidated material about the walls of the drilled hole and drilling 
fluid also invades these walls, forming a mud cake.  In consolidated rocks, 
cuttings, fine particles and mud can be forced into joints and fractures.  
Thus, the borehole walls become clogged, reducing the potential yield and 
causing a drawdown to be increased.  Proper well development breaks down the 
compacted walls (or opens fractures) and draws the material into the well 
where it can be removed.  Obviously, the more thorough the development the 
better the well will perform.  Adequacy of development is largely a matter of 
experience and judgment.  The success of development can be measured by the 
amount of sand produced during interrupted pumping and the final specific 
capacity of the well.

<P><I>Testing for Sand</I>.  The sand content should be tested after development and 
performance (pump) testing.  Sand production should be measured by a 
centrifugal sand sampler<A HREF="javascript:newWindow4()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 4</SUP></FONT></A>
 or other acceptable means.  Following development 
(i.e., stabilization of the formation and/or gravel pack) and pump testing, 
the sand content should not exceed a concentration of 5 ppm (parts per 
million) by weight 15 minutes after the start of pumping.

<P>Sand production exceeding this limit indicates that the well may not be 
completely developed or may not have been properly designed.  In that event, 
redevelopment may be appropriate or as an alternative, a sand separator 
installed.  In existing wells should this value be exceeded significantly, 
rehabilitation (redevelopment) or repair is probably needed.  Again, as an 
alternative, a sand separator may need to be installed.
