<P><CENTER><B>Developing the Standards</B></CENTER>

<P>The Department of Water Resources began formulating standards for the 
construction of water wells and the destruction of abandoned wells shortly 
after the enactment of <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">Water Code</a> Section 231 in 1949.  The Department made a 
comprehensive survey of existing laws and regulations governing well 
construction and abandonment in the then 47 other states and in the counties 
and cities of California.  This survey culminated in the publication of 
"Water Quality Investigations Report No. 9 – Abstracts of Laws and 
Recommendations Concerning Water Well Construction and Sealing in the United 
States", April 1955.  Although the report is over 25 years old, it remains a 
useful source of background information.  The Department has continued to 
keep informed of practices in other states, particularly those in which 
standards have been established, and changes in the status of California 
county well ordinances.

<P>Concurrently the Department assembled and evaluated information on the 
development of well standards in California.  The information was grouped 
into three broad categories:  (1) groundwater geology and hydrology, (2) 
Impairment of groundwater quality, and (3) water well construction practices.  
The latter included suggestions and recommendations on methods and materials 
from representatives of State and federal agencies, steel companies, casing 
fabricators, pump manufacturers, water well drilling contractors, and other 
organizations and individuals concerned with the development and use of 
groundwater.

<P>This activity culminated in the publication of the standards in their initial 
draft form, "Recommended Minimum Well Construction and Sealing Standards for 
Protection of Groundwater Quality State of California", Bulletin 74, 
Preliminary Edition, July 1962.  In March and April 1965, the Department 
conducted a series of public hearings in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of 
Health Services</a> at six cities in the State.  Discussion and comments received 
centered on two areas:  (1) the standards recommended, and (2) means of 
implementation.  Most of those concerned felt that the standards, as written, 
were too general.  Accordingly, the Department decided to redraft them.

<P>Following a review of all prior material and comments received during the 
period 1963 through 1966, the Department published an interim edition of the 
chapter containing the standards in February 1967.  Two public hearings on 
the interim edition were held in May 1967, and written comments were received 
as part of the record.  These were also joint hearings with the <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of 
Health Services</a>.

<P>The eight hearings produced correspondence and an extensive file of 
transcripts containing information, opinions, and suggestions, which would 
fill several volumes, if published.

<P>In February 1968 the standards were issued in their current form.

<P>For the most part, the standards can be applied anywhere in the State under 
practically any conditions.  The procedures for closing-off the avenues of 
access, properly locating a well, destroying an abandoned well, etc., in Del 
Norte County, at the northwest corner of California, are similar to those in 
western Fresno County.  Similarly, sealing-off the water in one or more zones 
or aquifers, to prevent its migration to other zones or aquifers, may be just 
as desirable for a well in western Merced County as it is at one on the 
Oxnard plain of Ventura County although, perhaps, for different reasons.  
However, in specific areas of the State it has been necessary to define the 
existing geologic and hydrologic conditions and the circumstances under which 
these standards should be applied.  For example, it is helpful to describe 
the areal and vertical extent of geologic materials where sealing is needed 
to prevent the migration of poor quality water.

<P>Thus, the Department maintained a concurrent and subsequent activity 
consisting of studies and reports describing the application of standards in 
designated areas of California.  And, in addition to Bulletin 74, the 
Department issued a number of reports containing well standards for those 
areas (see Table 1).<A HREF="javascript:newWindow1()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 1</SUP></FONT></A>

<TR><TD bgcolor=fff99d><FONT size=-1>* One other report, Bulletin 74-1, "Cathodic Protection Well Standards: 
State of California", March 1973 deals with another kind of well. 
Cathodic protection wells house devices used to alleviate electrolytic corrosion of 
pipelines, tanks, and similar installations. Such wells may also function as 
instruments for the deterioration of groundwater quality. For that reason, standards 
for their construction and destruction have also been issued.</FONT>
