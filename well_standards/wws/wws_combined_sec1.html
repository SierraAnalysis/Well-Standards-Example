CHAPTER II.  STANDARDS


<P><CENTER><B>Part I. General</B></CENTER></P>

<B>Section 1. Definitions.</B><A HREF="javascript:newWindow5()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 5</SUP></FONT></A> 

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Well or Water Wells</I>.  As defined in Section 13710 of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">Water Code</a>, well 
or water well:</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"…means any artificial excavation constructed by any method for the purpose 
of extracting water from, or injecting water into, the underground.  This 
definition shall not include:  (a) oil and gas wells, or geothermal wells 
constructed under the jurisdiction of the <a href="http://www.consrv.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department on Conservation</a>, except 
those wells converted to use as water wells; or (b) wells used for the 
purpose of (1) dewatering excavations during construction, or (2) stabilizing 
hillsides or earth embankments."</BLOCKQUOTE>     

<LI><I>Community Water Supply Well</I>.  A water well used to supply water for 
domestic purposes in systems subject to Chapter 7, Part 1, Division 5 of the 
<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=hsc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">California Health and Safety Code</a>. 
Included are wells supplying public water 
systems classified by the <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Health Services</a> as "Noncommunity 
water systems" and "State small water systems" (California Waterworks 
Standards, Title 22, California Administrative Code).  Such wells are 
variously referred to as "Municipal Wells", "City Wells", or "Public Water 
Supply Wells".</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Individual Domestic Well</I>.  A water well used to supply water for the 
domestic needs of an individual residence or systems of four or less service 
connections (or "hook-ups" as they are often called).</L>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Industrial Wells</I>.  Water wells used to supply industry on an individual 
basis (in contrast to supplies provided through community systems).</L>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Agricultural Wells</I>.  Water wells used to supply water only for irrigation 
or other agricultural purposes, including so-called "stock wells".</L>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Recharge or Injection Wells</I>.  Wells constructed to introduce water into 
the ground as a means of replenishing groundwater basins, repelling the 
intrusion of seawater or disposing of waste water.<A HREF="javascript:newWindow6()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 6</SUP></FONT></A></L>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Air-conditioning Wells</I>.  Wells constructed to return to the groundwater 
which has been used as a coolant in air conditioning processes.  Because the 
water introduced into these wells is degraded (from the standpoint of 
temperature), such wells have been construed as waste discharges and are, 
therefore, subject to the water quality control laws (Division 7 of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=wat&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">Water 
Code</a> and Division 5 of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=hsc&codebody=&hits=20" target="_blank">Health and Safety Code</a>).</L>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Horizontal Wells</I>.  Water wells drilled horizontally or at an angle with 
the horizon (as contrasted with the common vertical well).  This definition 
does not apply to horizontal drains or "wells" constructed to remove 
subsurface water from hillsides, cuts, or fills (such installations are used 
to prevent or correct conditions that produce landslides).</L>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Exploration Hole (or Boring)</I>.  An uncased, temporary excavation whose 
purpose is the determination of hydrologic conditions at a site.</L>
<BR><BR>
                                                                                                
<LI><I>Test Wells</I>.  Wells constructed to obtain information needed for design of 
other wells.  Test wells should not be confused with "exploration holes", 
which are temporary.  Test wells are cased and can be converted to other uses 
such as groundwater monitoring and, under certain circumstances, to 
production wells.</L>  
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Inactive or Standby Well</I>.  A well not routinely operating, but capable of 
being made operable with a minimum effort.</L>  
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Enforcing Agency</I>.  An agency designated by duly authorized local, 
regional, or State government to administer and enforce laws or ordinances 
pertaining to the construction, alteration, maintenance, and destruction of 
water wells.  The California State <a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov" target="_blank">Department of Health Services</a> or the local 
health agency is the enforcing agency for community water supply wells.</L>
