CHAPTER II.  STANDARDS


<P id="sec12"><B>Section 12.  Casing.</B></P>	


<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><I>Casing Material.</I><A HREF="javascript:newWindow14()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 14</SUP></FONT></A>  Requirements pertaining to well casing are to insure 
that the casing will perform the functions for which it is designed, i.e., to 
maintain the hole by preventing its walls from collapsing, to provide a 
channel for the conveyance of the water, and to provide a measure of 
protection for the quality of the water pumped.
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>Well casing shall be strong and tough enough to resist the force imposed 
on it during installation and those forces which can normally be expected 
after installation.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI>Steel is the material most frequently used for well casing, especially in 
drilled wells.  The thickness of steel used for well casing shall be selected 
in accordance with good design practices applied with due consideration to 
conditions at the site of the well.<A HREF="javascript:newWindow15()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 15</SUP></FONT></A>  There are three principal 
classifications of steel materials used for water well casing, and all are 
acceptable for use so long as they meet the following conditions.
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><I>Standard and line pipe.</I>  This material shall meet one of the following 
specifications, including the latest revision thereof:

<P>(1) API Std. 5L, "Specification for Line Pipe".</P>

<P>(2) API Std. 5LX, "Specification for High-Test Line Pipe".</P>

<P>(3) ASTM A53, "Standard Specification for Pipe, Steel, Black and Hot-Dipped, 
Zinc-Coated Welded and Seamless".</P>

<P>(4) ASTM A120, "Standard Specification for Pipe, Steel, Black and Hot-Dipped, 
Zinc-Coated (Galvanized) Welded and Seamless, for Ordinary Uses".</P>

<P>(5) ASTM A134, "Standard Specification for Electric-Fusion (Arc)-Welded Steel 
Pipe (sizes NPS 16 and over)".</P>

<P>(9) AWWA C200, "AWWA Standard for Steel Water Pipe 6 Inches and Larger".</P>               
</LI>

<LI><I>Structural Steel.</I>  This material shall meet one of the following 
specifications of the <a href="http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/index.shtml?E+mystore" target="_blank">American Society for Testing and Materials</a>, including 
the latest revision thereof:
  
<P>(1) ASTM A36, "Standard Specification for Structural Steel".</P>

<P>(2) ASTM A242, "Standard Specification for High Strength Low Alloy Structural 
Steel".</P>

<P>(3) ASTM A283, "Standard Specification for Low and Intermediate Tensile

Structural Manganese Vanadium Steel".</P>

<P>(5) ASTM A570, "Standard Specification for Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Sheet and 
Strip, Structural Quality".</P>  
</LI>

<LI>High strength carbon steel sheets referred by their manufacturers and 
fabricators as "well casing steel".  At present, there are no standard 
specifications concerning this material.  However, the major steel producers 
market products whose chemical and physical properties are quite similar.  
Each sheet of material shall contain mill markings which will identify the 
manufacturer and specify that the material is well casing steel which 
complies with the chemical and physical properties published by the 
manufacturer.</LI>          
<BR><BR>

<LI>Stainless steel casing shall meet the provisions of ASTM A409, "Standard 
Specification for Welded Large Diameter Austenitic Steel Pipe for Corrosive 
or High Temperature Service".</LI>
</LI></OL>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Plastic.</I>  Two basic types of plastic are commonly used for plastic well 
casing:  thermoplastics and thermosets.  Thermoplastics soften with the 
application of heat and reharden when cooled.  Thermoplastics can be reformed 
repeatedly using heat and sometimes can unexpectedly deform.  Attention 
should be given to the effect of heat on thermoplastic casing from the 
setting and curing of cement.  Additional discussion on sealing material and 
heat generation is in <a href="wws_combined_sec9.html#subd">Section 9, Subsection D, 'Sealing Material'</a>.

<P>Thermoplastics used for well casing include ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene 
styrene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and SR (styrene rubber).  PVC is the most 
frequently used thermoplastic well casing in California.  Styrene rubber is 
seldom used.</P>

<P>Unlike thermoplastics, thermoset plastics cannot be reformed after heating.  
The molecules of thermoset plastic are 'set' during manufacturing by heat, 
chemical action, or a combination of both.  The thermoset plastic most 
commonly used for well casing is fiberglass.</P>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><I>Thermoplastics.</I>  Thermoplastic well casing shall meet the requirements of 
ASTM F480. Standard Specification for Thermoplastic Well Casing Pipe and 
Couplings Made in Standard Dimension Ratios (SDR), SCH 40 and SCH 80, 
including the latest revision thereof.  (Note:  A 'dimension ratio' is the 
ratio of pipe diameter to pipe wall thickness.)</P>

<P>Pipe made in Schedule 40 and 80 wall thicknesses and pipe designated according 
to certain pressure classifications are listed in ASTM F480, as well as 
casing specials referencing the following ASTM specifications:</P>

<P>(1) ABS Pipe.  ASTM D1527, Standard Specification for Acrylonitrile-
Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) Plastic Pipe, Schedules 40 and 80.</P>

<P>(2) PVC Pipe.  ASTM D1785, Standard Specification for (Poly Vinyl Chloride) 
(PVC) Plastic Pipe, Schedules 40, 80, and 120.</P>

<P>(3) Pressure-Rated PVC Pipe.  ASTM D2241, Standard Specifications for Poly 
(Vinyl Chloride) (PVC) Pressure-Rated Pipe (SDR Series).</P>

<P>Thermoplastic well casing that may be subject to signifiant impact stress 
during or after installation shall meet or exceed the requirements for impact 
resistance classification set forth in Section 6.5 of ASTM F480.  Casing that 
may be subject to significant impact forces includes, but is not limited to; 
casing that is installed in large diameter, deep boreholes; and casing 
through which drilling tools pass following installation of the casing in a 
borehole.</P>
</LI>

<LI><I>Thermoset Plastics.</I>  Thermoset casing material shall meet the following 
specifi-cations, as applicable, including the latest revisions thereof:

<P>(1) Filament Wound Resin Pipe.  ASTM D2996, Standard Specification for 
Filament Wound Reinforced Thermosetting Resin Pipe.</P>

<P>(2) Centrifugally Cast Resin Pipe.  ASTM D2997, Standard Specification for 
Centrifugally Cast Reinforced Thermosetting Resin Pipe.</P>

<P>(3) Reinforced Plastic Mortar Pressure Pipe.  ASTM D3517, Standard 
Specification for Reinforced Plastic Mortar Pressure Pipe.</P>

<P>(4) Glass Fiber Reinforced Resin Pressure Pipe. AWWA<A HREF="javascript:newWindow16()"><FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>Note 16</SUP></FONT></A> C950, AWWA Standards for 
Glass-Fiber-Reinforced Thermosetting-Resin Pressure Pipe.</P>
</LI>

<LI><I>Drinking Water Supply.</I>  All plastic casing used for drinking water supply 
wells, including community supply well and individual domestic wells, shall 
meet the provisions of <a href="http://www.nsf.org" target="_blank">National Sanitation Foundation</a> Standard No. 14, 
Plastic Piping Components and related Materials and any revision thereof.  
The casing shall be marked or labeled following requirements in NSF Standard 
No. 14.  Standard No. 14 includes the requirements of ASTM F480.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Storage, Handling, and Transportation.</I>  Plastic casing shall not be 
stored in direct sunlight or subjected to freezing temperatures for extended 
periods of time.  Plastic casing shall be stored, handled, and transported in 
a manner that prevents excessive mechanical stress.  Casing shall be 
protected from sagging and bending, severe impacts and loads, and potentially 
harmful chemicals.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Large Diameter Wells.</I>  Because large diameter plastic casing has not been 
used extensively at depths exceeding 500 feet, special care shall be 
exercised with its use in deep wells.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI id="item4">Concrete pipe used for casing should conform to the following specifications, 
including the latest revision thereof:

<P>(a) ASTM C14, "Standard Specifications for Concrete Sewer, Storm Drain, and 
Culvert Pipe".</P>

</LI>

<LI><I>Unacceptable Casing Materials.</I>  Galvanized sheet metal pipe such as 
'downspout' tile pipe, or natural wood shall not be used as well casing.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Other Materials.</I>  Materials in addition to those described above may be 
used as well casing, subject to enforcing agency approval.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Casing Installation.</I>  All well casing shall be assembled and installed 
with sufficient care to prevent damage to casing sections and joints.  All 
casing joints above intervals if perforations or screen shall be watertight.  
Any perforations shall be below the depths specified in <a href="wws_combined_sec9.html#suba">Section 9, Subsection 
A</a>, above.

<P>Casing shall be equipped with centering guides or 'centralizers' to ensure 
the even radial thickness of the annular seal and filter pack.</P>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI><I>Metal Casing.</I>  Metallic casing may be joined by welds, threads, or 
threaded couplings.  Welding shall be accomplished in accordance with the 
standards of the <a href="http://www.aws.org/" target="_blank">American Welding Society</a> or the most recent revision of the 
<a href="http://www.asme.org/" target="_blank">American Society of Mechanical Engineers</a> Boiler Construction Code.  Metallic 
casing shall be equipped with a 'drive shoe' at the lower end if it is driven 
into place.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Plastic Casing.</I>  Plastic casing may be joined by solvent welding or 
mechanically joined by threads or other means, depending on the type of 
material and its fabrication.  Solvent cement used for solvent welding shall 
meet specifications for the type of plastic casing used.  Solvent cement 
shall be applied in accordance with solvent and casing manufacturer 
instructions.  Particular attention shall be given to instructions pertaining 
to required setting time for joints to develop strength.

<P>The following specifications for solvent cements and joints for PVC casing 
shall be met, including the latest revisions thereof:</P>

<LI><I>ASTM D2855</I>, Standard Practice for Making Solvent-Cemented Joints with 
Poly (Vinyl Chloride) (PVC) Pipe and Fittings.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Plastic casing or screen shall not be subjected to excessive stress during 
installation and shall not be driven into place.  Care shall be taken to 
ensure that plastic casing and joints are not subjected to excessive heat 
from cement-based sealing material.</P>

<P>A specifically designed adapter shall be used to join plastic casing to 
metallic casing or screen.</P>
