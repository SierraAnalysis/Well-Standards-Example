<P><FONT size=-1>Aluminum placed in an aggressive soil is subject to electrolytic corrosion.
 When the soil pH is very high (over 8.0) or very low (under 6.0) this could present problems and, therefore, the soil pH ought to be checked.
 In addition, galvanic corrosion is likely to take place unless the pump is also made of aluminum.
 Accordingly, the use of most of the aluminum alloys currently available is not recommended</FONT><BR>
