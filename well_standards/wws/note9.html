<P><FONT size=-1>A program to protect underground drinking water sources from endangerment by the subsurface emplacement of fluids through well injection is required under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (Public Law 93-523) signed into law December 16, 1974.
 On June 24, 1980, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued rules and regulations establishing technical criteria and standards governing the construction of injection wells.
 Revisions were made August 27, 1981, and October 1, 1981.
 These regulations are Part 146 of Title 40, Protection of Environment, of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR146).</FONT><BR>
