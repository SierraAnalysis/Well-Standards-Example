CHAPTER II.  STANDARDS

<P>The standards presented in this chapter are intended to apply to the 
construction (including major reconstruction) or destruction of water wells 
throughout the State of California.  However, under certain circumstances, 
adequate protection of groundwater quality may require more stringent 
standards than those presented here; under other circumstances, it may be 
necessary to substitute other measures which will provide protection equal to 
that provided by these standards.  Such situations arise from practicalities 
in applying any standards or, in this case, from anomalies in groundwater 
geology or hydrology.  Since it is impractical to prepare standards for every 
conceivable situation, provision has been made for deviation from the 
standards as well as for additional ones.  However, the Department believes 
that for most conditions encountered in the State, the standards presented in 
this report are satisfactory for the protection of groundwater quality.</P>

<P>In the past, the Department expended considerable effort in defining areas 
where standards should be applied to prevent the mixing of waters of 
differing qualities in specific groundwater areas in California.  For 
example, groundwaters of varying quality in the San Joaquin Valley are 
naturally separated by a confining bed commonly called the "Corcoran Clay".  
The standards presented in this chapter continue to support the findings and 
recommendations made regarding the application of standards to the specific 
areas previously studied.  (See <a href="../b74-81chap1c.html#tab1">Table 1, Chapter I</a>.)</P>
