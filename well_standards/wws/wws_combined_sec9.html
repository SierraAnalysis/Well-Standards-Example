<P>The space between the well casing and the wall of the drilled hole, often 
referred to as the annular space, shall be effectively sealed to prevent it 
from being a preferential pathway for movement of poor-quality water, 
pollutants, or contaminants.  In some cases, secondary purposes of an annular 
seal are to protect casing against corrosion or degradation, ensure the 
structural integrity of the casing, and stabilize the borehole wall.</P>

<LI><I>Shallow groundwater.</I>  Exceptions to minimum seal depths can be made for 
shallow wells at the approval of the enforcing agency, where the water to be 
produced is at a depth less than 20 feet.  In no case shall an annular seal 
extend to a total depth less than 10 feet below land surface.  The annular 
seal shall be no less than 10 feet in length. 

<P>Caution shall be given to locating a well with a 'reduced' annular seal with 
respect to sources of pollution or contamination.  Such precautions include 
horizontal separation distances greater than those listed in <a href="wws_combined_sec8.html#sec8">Section 8</a>, above.</P></LI>


<LI><I>Encroachment on known or potential sources of pollution or contamination.</I>  
When, at the approval of the enforcing agency, a water well is to be located 
closer to a source of pollution or contamination than allowed by <a href="wws_combined_sec8.html#sec8">Section 8</a>, 
above, the annular space shall be sealed from ground surface to the 
first impervious stratum, if possible.  The annular seal for all such wells 
shall extend to a minimum depth of 50 feet.</LI>

<LI><I>Areas of freezing.</I>  The top of an annular surface seal may be below 
ground surface in areas where freezing is likely, but in no case more than 4 
feet below ground surface.  'Freezing' areas are those where the mean length 
of the freeze-free period described by the National Weather Service is less 
than 100 days.  In other word, 'freezing' areas are where temperatures at or 
below 32 degrees Fahrenheit are likely to occur on any day during a period of 
265 or more days each year.  In general, these areas include:

other conditions require, if the seal and casing extend to a watertight and 
structurally sound subsurface vault, or equivalent feature.  In no case shall 
the top of the annular surface seal be more than 4 feet below ground surface.  
The vault shall extend from the top of the annular seal to at least ground 
surface.

<P>The use of subsurface vaults to house the top of water wells below ground 
surface is rare and is discouraged due to susceptibility to the entrance of 
surface water, pollutants, and contaminants.  Where appropriate, pitless 
adapters should be used in place of vaults.</P>

<LI id="subb"><I>Sealing Conditions.</I>  The following requirements are to be observed for 
sealing the annular space:</LI>  
<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI id="item1"><I>Wells drilled in unconsolidated, caving material.</I>  An 'oversized' hole, 
at least 4 inches greater in diameter than the outside diameter of the well 
casing, shall be drilled and a conductor casing temporarily installed to at 
least the minimum depth of annular seal specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above.
 Permanent conductor casing may be used if it is installed in 
accordance with <a href="#item3">Item 3</a> and <a href="#item5">Item 5</a>, below and if it extends at least to the depth specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above.  
One purpose of conductor casing is to hold the annular space open during well 
drilling and during the placement of the well casing and annular seal. 

<P><IMG SRC="../figures/74-81fig4.jpg" ALIGN=right BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=535 ALT="Figure 2">
Temporary conductor casing shall be withdrawn as sealing material is placed 
between the well casing and borehole wall, as shown in Figure 4A (Bulletin 74-81).
 Sealing material shall be placed at least within the 
interval specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above.  The sealing material shall be 
kept at a sufficient height above the bottom of the temporary conductor 
casing as it is withdrawn to prevent caving of the borehole wall.</P>  

<P>Temporary conductor casing may be left in place in the borehole after the 
placement of the annular seal only if it is impossible to remove because of 
unforeseen conditions and not because of inadequate drilling equipment, or if 
its removal will seriously jeopardize the integrity of the well and the 
integrity of subsurface barriers to pollutant or contaminant movement.  
Temporary conductor casing may be left in place only at the approval of the 
enforcing agency on a case-by-case basis.</P>  

<P>Every effort shall be made to place sealing material between the outside of 
temporary conductor casing that cannot be removed and the borehole wall to 
fill any possible gaps or voids between the conductor casing and the borehole 
wall.  At least two inches of sealing material shall be maintained between 
the conductor casing and well casing.  At a minimum, sealing material shall 
extend through intervals specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above.</P>  

<P>Sealing material can often be placed between temporary conductor casing that 
cannot be removed and the borehole wall by means of pressure grouting 
techniques, as described below and in <a href="../b74-81appendixb.html">Appendix B</a> (Bulletin 74-81).  
Other means of placing sealing material between the conductor casing and the 
borehole wall can be used, at the approval of the enforcing agency.</P>  

<P>Pressure grouting shall be accomplished by perforating temporary conductor 
casing that cannot be removed, in place.  The perforations are to provide 
passages for sealing material to pass through the conductor casing to fill 
any spaces and voids between the casing and borehole wall.  Casing 
perforations shall be a suitable size and density to allow the passage of 
sealing materials through the casing and the proper distribution of sealing 
material in spaces between the casing and borehole wall.  At a minimum, the 
perforations shall extend through the intervals specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, 
above, unless otherwise approved by the enforcing agency.</P>  

<P>Temporary conductor casing that must be left in place shall be perforated 
immediately before sealing operations begin to prevent drilling or well 
construction operations from clogging casing perforations.  Once the casing 
has been adequately perforated, sealing material shall be placed inside the 
conductor casing and subjected to sufficient pressure to cause the sealing 
material to pass through the conductor casing perforations and completely 
fill any spaces or voids between the casing and borehole wall, at least 
within the intervals specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above.  Sealing material 
shall consist of neat cement, or bentonite prepared from powdered bentonite 
and water, unless otherwise approved by the enforcing agency.</P>  

<P>Sealing material must also fill the annular space between the conductor 
casing and the well casing within required sealing intervals.</P></LI>  

<LI><I>Wells drilled in unconsolidated material with significant clay layers.</I>  
An 'oversized' hole, at least 4 inches greater in diameter than the outside 
diameter of the well casing, shall be drilled to at least the depth specified 
in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above, and the annular space between the borehole 
wall and the well casing filled with sealing material in accordance with 
<a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above (see Figure 4B, above).  If a 
significant layer of clay or clay-rich deposits of low permeability is 
encountered within 5 feet of the minimum seal depth prescribed in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, 
above, the annular seal shall be extended at least 5 feet into the clay 
layer.  Thus, the depth of seal could be required to be extended as much a 
another 10 feet.  If the clay layer is less than 5 feet in total thickness, 
the seal shall extend through its entire thickness.  

<P>If caving material is present within the interval specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, 
a temporary conductor casing shall be installed to hold the borehole open 
during well drilling and placement of the casing and annular seal, in 
accordance with the requirements of <a href="#item1">Item 1</a>, above.  Permanent 
conductor casing may be used if it is installed in accordance with Item 3 and <a href="#item5">Item 5</a>, 
below, and it extends to at least the depth specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above.</P></LI>  

<LI id="item3"><I>Wells drilled in soft consolidated formations (extensive clays, 
sandstones, etc.).</I>  An 'oversized' hole, at least 4 inches greater than the 
outside diameter of the well casing, shall be drilled to at least the depth

and the borehole shall be filled with sealing material to at least the depth 
specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above, as shown by Figure 4C, above. 

<P>If a permanent conductor casing is to be installed to facilitate the 
construction of the well, an oversized hole, at least 4 inches greater in 
diameter than the outside surface of the permanent conductor casing, shall be 
drilled to the bottom of the conductor casing or to at least the depth 
specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above, and the annular space between the conductor 
casing and the borehole wall filled with sealing material.  In some cases, 
such as in cable tool drilling, it may be necessary to extend permanent 
conductor casing beyond the depth of the required depth of the annular 
surface seal in order to maintain the borehole.  Sealing material is not 
required between conductor casing and the borehole wall other than the depths 
specified in <a href="#suba">Subsection A</a>, above, and <a href="wws_combined_sec13.html#sec13">Section 13</a>, below.</P>

<LI><I>Water.</I>  Water used to prepare sealing mixtures should generally be of 
drinking water quality, shall be compatible with the type of sealing material 
used, be free of petroleum and petroleum products, and be free of suspended

milligrams per liter chloride and 1,500 mg/l sulfate, can be used for cement-based sealing mixtures.  
The quality of water to be used for sealing mixtures 
shall be determined where unknown.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Cement.</I>  Cement used in sealing mixtures shall meet the requirements of 
<a href="http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/index.shtml?E+mystore" target="_blank">American Society for Testing and Materials</a> C150, Standard Specification for 
Portland Cement, including the latest revisions thereof.

<P>Types of Portland cement available under ASTM C150 for general construction 
are:</P>

<P>Type I    -  General purpose.  Similar to <a href="http://api-ec.api.org/intro/index_noflash.htm" target="_blank">American Petroleum Institute</a> Class 
A.</P>

<P>Type II   -  Moderate resistance to sulfate.  Lower heat of hydration than 
Type I. Similar to API Class B.</P>

<P>Type III  -  High early strength.  Reduced curing time but higher heat of 
hydration than Type I.  Similar to API Class C.</P>

<P>Type IV  -  Extended setting time.  Lower heat of hydration than Types I and 
III.</P>

<P>Type V   -  High sulfate resistance.</P>

<P>Special cement setting accelerators and retardants and other additives may be 
used in some cases.  Special field additives for Portland cement mixtures 
shall meet the requirements of ASTM C494, Standard Specification for Chemical 
Admixtures for Concrete, and latest revision thereof.</P>

<P>Hydrated lime may be added up to 10 percent of the volume of cement used to 
make the seal mix more fluid.  Bentonite may be added to cement-based mixes, 
up to 6 percent by weight of cement used, to improve fluid characteristics of 
the sealing mix and reduce the rate of heat generation during setting.</P>

<P>Dry additives should be mixed with dry cement before adding water to the 
mixture to ensure proper mixing, uniformity of hydration, and an effective and 
homogeneous seal.  The water demand of additives shall be taken into account 
when water is added to the mix.</P>

<P>Minimum times required for sealing materials containing Portland cement to 
set and begin curing before construction operations on a well can be resumed 
are:</P>

<UL TYPE="disc">
<li>Types I and II cement – 24 hours
<li>Type III cement – 12 hours
<li>Type V cement – 6 hours
</UL>

<P>Type IV cement is seldom used for annular seals because of its extended 
setting time.</P>

<P>Allowable setting times may be reduced or lengthened by use of accelerators 
or retardants specifically designed to modify setting time, at the approval 
of the enforcing agency.</P>

<P>More time shall be required for cement-based seals to cure to allow greater 
strength when construction or development operations following the placement 
of the seal may subject casing and sealing materials to significant stress.  
Subjecting a well to significant stress before a cement-based sealing 
material has adequately cured can damage the seal and prevent proper bonding 
of cement-based sealants to casing(s).</P>

<P>If plastic well casing is used, care shall be exercised to control the heat 
of hydration generated during the setting and curing of cement in an annular 
seal.  Heat can cause plastic casing to weaken and collapse.  Heat generation 
is a special concern if thin-wall plastic well casing is used, if the well 
casing will be subject to significant net external pressure before the 
setting of the seal, and/or if the radial thickness of the annular seal is 
large.  Additives that accelerate cement setting also tend to increase the 
rate of heat generation during setting and, thus, should be used with caution 
where plastic casing is employed.</P>

<P>The temperature of a setting cement seal can be lowered by circulating water 
inside the well casing and/or by adding bentonite to the cement mixture, up 
to 6 percent by weight of cement used.</P>

<P>Cement-based sealing material shall be constituted as follows:</P>

<OL TYPE="a">
<li><I>Neat Cement.</I>  For Types I or II Portland cement, neat cement shall be 
mixed at a ratio of one 94-pound sack of Portland cement 5 to 6 gallons of 
'clean' water.  Additional water may be required where special additives, 
such as bentonite, or 'accelerators' or 'retardants' are used.</li><BR><BR>

<li><I>Sand Cement.</I>  Sand-cement shall be mixed at a ratio of not more than 188 
pounds of sand to one 94-pound sack of Portland cement (2 parts sand to 1 
part cement, by weight) and about 7 gallons of clean water, where Type I or 
Type II Portland cement is used.  This is equivalent to a '10.3 sack mix.'  
Less water shall be used if less sand than 2 parts sand per one part cement 
by weight is used.  Additional water may be required when special additives, 
such as bentonite, or 'accelerators' or 'retardants' are used.</li><BR><BR>

<li><I>Concrete.</I>  Concrete is often useful for large volume annular seals, such 
as in large-diameter wells.  The proper use of aggregate can decrease the 
permeability of the annular seal, reduce shrinkage, and reduce the heat of 
hydration generated by the seal.<BR><BR>

Concrete shall consist of Portland cement and aggregate mixed at a ratio of 
at least six-94 pound sacks of Portland cement per cubic yard of aggregate.  
A popular concrete mix consists of eight-94 pound sacks of Type I or Type II 
Portland cement per cubic yard of uniform 3/8-inch aggregate.<BR><BR>

In no case shall the size of the aggregate be more than 1/5 the radial 
thickness of the annular seal.  Water shall be added to concrete mixes to 
attain proper consistency for placement, setting, and curing.</li><BR><BR>

<li><I>Mixing.</I>  Cement-based sealing materials shall be mixed thoroughly to 
provide uniformity and ensure that no 'lumps' exist.<BR><BR>

Ratios of the components of cement-based sealing materials can be varied 
depending on the type of cement and additives used.  Variations must be 
approved by the enforcing agency.</li>
</OL>
</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Bentonite.</I>  Bentonite clay in 'gel' form has some of the advantages of 
cement-based sealing material.  A disadvantage is that the clay can sometimes 
separate from the clay-water mixture.

<P>Although many types of clay mixtures are available, none has sealing 
properties comparable to bentonite clay.  Bentonite expands significantly in 
volumes when hydrated.  Only bentonite clay is an acceptable clay for annular 
seals.</P>

<P>Unamended bentonite clay seals should not be used where structural strength 
of the seal is required, or where it will dry.  Bentonite seals may have a 
tendency to dry, shrink and crack in arid and semi-arid areas of California 
where subsurface moisture levels can be low.  Bentonite clay seals can be 
adversely affected by subsurface chemical conditions, as can cement-based 
materials.</P>

<P>Bentonite clay shall not be used as a sealing material if roots from trees 
and other deep rooted plants might invade and disrupt the seal, and/or damage 
the well casing.  Roots may grow in an interval containing a bentonite seal 
depending on surrounding soil conditions and vegetation.</P>

<P>Bentonite-based sealing material shall not be used for sealing intervals of 
fractured rock or sealing intervals of highly unstable, unconsolidated 
material that could collapse and displace the sealing material, unless 
otherwise approved by the enforcing agency.  Bentonite clay shall not be used 
as a sealing material where flowing water might erode it.</P>

<P>Bentonite clay products used for sealing material must be specifically 
prepared for such use.  Used drilling mud and/or cuttings from drilling shall 
not be used in sealing material.</P>

<P>Bentonite used for annular seals shall be commercially prepared, powdered, 
granulated, pelletized, or chipped/crushed sodium montmorillonite clay.  The 
largest dimension of pellets or chips shall be less than 1/5 the radial 
thickness of the annular space into which they are placed.</P>

<P>Bentonite clay mixtures shall be thoroughly mixed with clean water prior to 
placement.  A sufficient amount of water shall be added to bentonite to allow 
proper hydration.  Depending on the bentonite sealing mixture used, 1 gallon 
of water should be added to about every 2 pounds of bentonite.  Water added 
to bentonite for hydration shall be of suitable quality and free of 
pollutants and contaminants.</P>

<P>Bentonite preparations normally require ½ to 1 hour to adequately hydrate.  
Actual hydration time is a function of site conditions and the form of 
bentonite used.  Finely divided forms of bentonite generally require less 
time for hydration, if properly mixed.</P>

<P>Dry bentonite pellets or chips may be placed directly into the annular space 
below water, where a short section of annular space, up to 10 feet in length, 
is to be sealed.  Care shall be taken to prevent bridging during the 
placement of bentonite seal material.</P></LI>
</OL>

<LI id="sube"><I>Radial Thickness of Seal.</I>  A minimum of two inches of sealing material 
shall be maintained between all casings and the borehole wall, within the 
interval to be sealed, except where temporary conductor casing cannot be 
removed, as noted in Subsection B, above.  A minimum of two inches 
of sealing material shall also be maintained between each casing, such as 
permanent conductor casing, well casing, gravel fill pipes, etc., in a 
borehole within the interval to be sealed, unless otherwise approved by the 
enforcing agency.  Additional space shall be provided, where needed, for 
casings to be properly centralized and spaced and allow the use of a tremie 
pipe during well construction (if required), especially for deeper wells.</LI>

<BR><BR>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI><I>Obstructions.</I>  All loose cuttings, or other obstructions to sealing shall 
be removed from the annular space before placement of the annular seal.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Centralizers.</I>  Well casing shall be equipped with centering guides or 
'centralizers' to ensure the 2-inch minimum radial thickness of the annular 
seal is at least mantained.  Centralizers need not be used in cases where the 
well casing is centered in the borehole during well construction by use of 
removable tools, such as hollow-stem augers.</P>

<P>The spacing of centralizers is normally dictated by the casing materials 
used, the orientation and straightness of the borehole, and the method used 
to install the casing.</P>

<P>Centralizers shall be metal, plastic, or other non-degradable material.  Wood 
shall not be used as a centralizer material.  Centralizers must be positioned 
to allow the proper placement of sealing material around casing within the 
interval to be sealed.</P>

<P>Any metallic component of a centralizer used with metallic casing shall 
consist of the same material as the casing.  Metallic centralizer components 
shall meet the same metallurgical specifications and standards as the metallic 
casing to reduce the potential for galvanic corrosion of the casing.</P></LI>

<LI><I>Foundation and Transition Seals.</I>  A packer or similar retaining device, 
or a small quantity of sealant that is allowed to set, can be placed at the 
bottom of the interval to be sealed before final sealing operations begin to 
form a foundation for the seal.</P>

<P>A transition seal, up to 5 feet in length, consisting of bentonite, is 
sometimes placed in the annular space to separate filter pack and cement-based sealing materials. 
The transition seal can prevent cement-based sealing 
materials from infiltrating the filter pack.  A short interval of fine-grained sand, usually less than 2 feet in length, is sometimes placed between 
the filter pack and the bentonite transition seal to prevent bentonite from 
entering the filter pack.  Also, fine sand is sometimes used in place of 
bentonite as the transition seal material.</P>

<P>Fine-sized forms of bentonite, such as granules and powder, are usually 
employed for transition seals if a transition seal is to be placed above the 
water level in a well boring.  Coarse forms of bentonite, such as pellets and 
chips, are often used where a bentonite transition seal is to be placed below 
the water level.</P>

<P>Transition seals should be installed by use of a tremie pipe, or equivalent.  
However, some forms of bentonite may tend to bridge or clog in a tremie pipe.</P>

<P>Bentonite can be placed in dry form or as slurry for use in transition seals.  
Water should be added to the bentonite transition seal prior to the placement 
of cement-based sealing materials where bentonite is dry in the borehole.  
Care should be exercised during the addition of water to the borehole to 
prevent displacing the bentonite.</P>

<P>Water should be added to bentonite at a ratio of about 1 gallon for every 2 
pounds of bentonite to allow for proper hydration.  Water added to bentonite 
for hydration shall be of suitable quality and free of pollutants and 
contaminants.</P>

<P>Sufficient time should be allowed for bentonite transition seals to properly 
hydrate before cement-based sealing materials are placed.  Normally, ½ to 1 
hour is required for proper hydration to occur.  Actual time of hydration is 
a function of site conditions.</P>

<P>The top of the transition seal shall be sounded to ensure that no bridging 
has occurred during placement.</P></LI>

<LI><I>Timing and Method of Placement.</I>  The annular space shall be sealed as 
soon as practical after completion of drilling or a stage of drilling.  In no 
case shall the annular space be left unsealed longer than 14 days following 
the installation of casing.</P>

<P>Sealing material shall be placed in one continuous operation from the bottom 
of the interval to be sealed, to the top of the interval.  Where the seal is 
more than 100 feet in length, the deepest portion of the seal may be 
installed first and allowed to set or partially set.  The deep initial seal 
shall be no longer than 10 feet in length.  The remainder of the seal shall 
be placed above the initial segment in one continuous operation.</P>

<P>Sealing material shall be placed by methods (such as the use of a tremie pipe 
or equivalent) that prevent freefall, bridging, or dilution of the sealing 
material, or separation of sand or aggregate from the sealing material.  
Annular sealing materials shall not be installed by freefall unless the 
interval to be sealed is dry and no deeper than 30 feet below ground surface.</P></LI>

<LI><I>Groundwater Flow.</I>  Special care shall be used to restrict the flow of 
groundwater into a well boring while placing material, where subsurface 
pressure causing the flow of water is significant.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Verification.</I>  It shall be verified that the volume of sealing material 
placed at least equals or exceeds the volume to be sealed.</LI>
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>Pressure.</I>  Pressure required for placement of sealing materials shall be 
maintained long enough for cement-based sealing materials to properly set.</LI>
