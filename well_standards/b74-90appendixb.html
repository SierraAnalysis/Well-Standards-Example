<P>Since Bulletin 74-81 was published in mid-1981 several new or revised 
publications have been issued that address groundwater or well construction.  
This appendix lists publications issued or revised since 1981 and selected 
other publications that were reviewed during the preparation of this 
supplement.  Publications that were used for Bulletin 74-81 that have since 
been revised are identified by a number in parentheses.  These numbers refer 
to the publication’s original position in the biography of Bulletin 74-81 
(<a href="b74-81appendixe.html">Appendix E</a>).</P>
